00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:44,813
Okay, time to eat.
Let's see... Open the app.

4
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,483
{\an8}I'm gonna get
a double pepperoni pizza,

5
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,153
{\an8}order of breadsticks,

6
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,907
{\an8}and, well,
lasagna. Yeah.

7
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:59,244
{\an8}New item alert?
Jalapeño breadstick quick bites.

8
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,206
{\an8}It might be nice to have
something in the salad family.

9
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,374
{\an8}And do I want dessert?

10
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:09,213
{\an8}I'm gonna be naughty,
butterscotch budino.

11
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:11,006
{\an8}Okay, I'm gonna have five.

12
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,550
Delivery?

13
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,137
Goes without saying.
Now, please.

14
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,141
{\an8}All right, that ought to hold me
'til breakfast.

15
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,894
{\an8}Hey! Wait, are you guys early
or am I late?

16
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:27,731
No matter. I have got
a real treat for you today.

17
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,609
No, not a treat for you.

18
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,738
Okay.

19
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,784
Anyway, about that treat.

20
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,329
Can I just say,
you will not be disappointed?

21
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:46,667
It's a story about me that
no one's ever heard before,

22
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,378
featuring someone in my life
you've never met.

23
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:53,507
I don't know about you,
but color me intrigued.

24
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,303
Yeah, drone delivery.

25
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,013
Welcome to the future.

26
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,474
You know, to really
understand everything,

27
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,018
I'm gonna have to take you back
to where it all began.

28
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,730
Don't want anything to take away
from the flavor of the cheese.

29
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,614
And like every great story,
it all started...

30
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,747
on a dark and stormy night.

31
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:36,216
Wait here, Junior.
I'll be right back.

32
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:57,256
<i>...moon hits your eye
like a big pizza pie</i>

33
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,341
<i>That's amore</i>

34
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:03,971
<i>- That's amore
- When the world seems to shine</i>

35
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:08,475
<i>Like you've had too much wine
That's amore</i>

36
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,686
<i>That's amore</i>

37
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,938
<i>- Bells will ring
- Ting-a-ling-a-ling</i>

38
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:16,483
<i>- Ting-a-ling-a-ling
- And you'll sing "vita bella"</i>

39
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,361
<i>Vita bella, vita bella</i>

40
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,405
- Open wide, Jake.
<i>- Hearts will play</i>

41
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:26,660
<i>Tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay
Like a gay tarantella</i>

42
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,203
<i>Lucky fella</i>

43
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,376
<i>When the stars make you drool</i>

44
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:38,547
<i>Just like pasta fasul
That's amore</i>

45
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,508
Hi there, little buddy! Hi!

46
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:45,470
<i>When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet</i>

47
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,391
<i>- You're in love</i>
- I'm so full.

48
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:54,521
<i>When you walk in a dream</i>

49
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,816
<i>But you know...</i>

50
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:03,280
- You hungry, little guy?
<i>- ...you're not dreaming, signore</i>

51
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,118
- You want a little more?
<i>- Scusami, but you see</i>

52
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,787
<i>- Back in old Napoli</i>
- You are a hungry little guy.

53
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:15,250
<i>- That's amore</i>
- That was a quick dinner,

54
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,335
Signore Jon.

55
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:20,464
You must have been very hungry.
Can I bring you anything else?

56
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,799
{\an8}Yes.

57
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,510
Thank you very much.

58
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,595
{\an8}Some... lasagna?

59
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,306
{\an8}- Si, lasagna for one.
- Yeah.

60
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,225
{\an8}You know what, no.

61
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,893
- Make it family-style.
- Very good.

62
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,687
- To go, please, Vito.
- Okay, everybody!

63
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,273
- What? Where'd he go?
- You all know this one!

64
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,399
Hey!

65
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,069
Stand up and sing. Join with us!

66
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:46,448
No! Hey!
Oh, no, I'm dancing.

67
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:50,661
Excuse me, pardon me.
I hate this. What? Hey! Oh, no.

68
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,581
Hey!

69
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:08,428
- Hey!
- Jon! Takeout for Jon!

70
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,558
- Hey!
- Your takeout is ready,

71
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,017
- Signore Jon.
- Yes.

72
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,812
One famiglia style lasagna,
to go.

73
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,315
- You eat alone too much, Jon.
- Yeah.

74
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,900
You should get on
the dating apps.

75
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,443
- There's Bumble, Tinder...
- I'm good, thanks.

76
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,653
Gluten-Free Singles...

77
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,572
- Hot Sauce Passions.
- No, I could never...

78
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,907
And you should spend serious
money on premium memberships.

79
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:29,992
Bye!

80
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,163
Hey!

81
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,749
Well, that was
an interesting dinner...

82
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,834
that you had.

83
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:44,381
Well, I guess...
this is where we say goodbye.

84
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,510
You're really cute

85
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,055
but I can't have pets
in my apartment.

86
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:59,146
So, I'll see you around. Okay?
Go on.

87
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:04,693
No. No, don't cry, don't cry.

88
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,033
No, no, no! No. Oh, no. Oh, no.

89
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,952
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

90
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,794
You don't have a home, do you?

91
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:37,017
<i>Scusami, but you see
Back in old Napoli</i>

92
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:41,605
<i>- That's amore
- Amore</i>

93
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:46,026
<i>That's amore</i>

94
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,656
And that's how I adopted Jon.

95
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,041
<i>So, I moved Jon
out of his apartment...</i>

96
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,211
<i>to this nice little two-bed,
two-bath in the suburbs.</i>

97
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,548
<i>As soon as he understood
the ground rules,</i>

98
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,300
<i>well, let's just say...
we were living the dream.</i>

99
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,140
<i>And once we were settled in,
I even let Jon get a pet.</i>

100
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,032
<i>Odie became
my most trusted ally.</i>

101
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,742
<i>He was kind, gentle...</i>

102
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:39,246
<i>and most importantly,
my unpaid intern.</i>

103
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,059
<i>Yeah, as you can see,</i>

104
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,645
<i>life here is
pretty near perfect.</i>

105
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:05,939
Well, yeah, except for...

106
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:08,984
Time to go to the vet!

107
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,238
We're gonna need the big scale!

108
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,033
Does she need to announce it
to the whole office?

109
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,503
No! Please, no! It's so hot,
it's really hurting!

110
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,221
And that's why we should go from
Sunday to Tuesday.

111
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,015
Okay. Where were we?

112
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,270
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.
Good morning!

113
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,796
What?
Where'd you get that chair?

114
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,349
<i>I think I was meant to be
here tonight</i>

115
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,851
<i>because I was meant to meet you.</i>

116
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,228
<i>- I think we were meant to be.
- That's what I meant to say.</i>

117
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,604
<i>You had me at the word, "meant."</i>

118
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,070
<i>We're gonna ride like the wind!</i>

119
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,573
<i>Faster! Harder! More insane!</i>

120
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,662
Odie?

121
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,163
Yeah, can you put this
back to normal?

122
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,582
There you go,
just let the pepperoni's

123
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,041
healing powers work its magic.

124
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,026
You saw nothing.

125
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,164
<i>Up until that moment,
my life was a perfect soufflé.</i>

126
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,793
<i>Little did I know
it was all about to collapse.</i>

127
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,382
<i>Imagine yourself drifting away</i>

128
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,801
<i>on a sea of tranquility.</i>

129
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,055
<i>There are no pets to bother you,</i>

130
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:46,725
<i>distract you
or max out your credit card</i>

131
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:50,938
<i>by excessively placing
online food orders.</i>

132
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,949
Yeah... Sorry...
What? Who said that?

133
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,036
Odie, Odie? Odie!

134
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,372
It's time for
our midnight snack.

135
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,922
Thank you, good sir,

136
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,632
your kindness will be rewarded.

137
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:28,183
What are we feeling
like today? French?

138
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:34,189
Italian? Chinese? Cupcakes?
Chinese it is.

139
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,859
Odie, shape everything
from the bottom two shelves

140
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:37,985
into a dumpling.

141
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,391
- Late night snackin'.
- Not good for digestion!

142
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,437
Odie, I'm dreamin' again.
Slap me across the face.

143
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,400
Nope. Still dreamin'.

144
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,943
I must be really deep
in this one.

145
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,621
{\an8}What do you guys...
You want money?

146
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,749
{\an8}I don't have any money, okay?
Who carries cash anymore?

147
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:36,668
I've got Jon's
credit card number memorized...

148
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:40,631
Five-5-5-2-3-8-5-7-5-5-2-1.
Did you write that down?

149
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:46,553
- Expiration code is 5-5-5.
- The cat is out of the bag!

150
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,937
I really hope
this kidnapping plan works

151
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,605
or she'll put us down...

152
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,942
with her insults
and cutting observations.

153
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,986
I think this is a case
of mistaken identity.

154
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,446
You must be looking for another

155
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,281
gorgeous, lovable
kitty cat, right?

156
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,493
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, where're you going?

157
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:10,994
No, no, come back, come back!

158
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,420
Odie? I'll handle this.
All right, you guys.

159
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,840
I'm giving you
to the count of three

160
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,009
to get back here
and let us down.

161
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,887
One, two, three!

162
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,140
Four, five...

163
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,475
I am not kidding here!

164
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:41,441
Three hundred and eight,
309, 300...

165
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,780
Yeah, they're not comin'.
It's over.

166
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,621
Am I dead?

167
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,709
Are you an angel?

168
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,634
Please, take me.

169
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,220
I am ready to go to that...

170
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,307
to that all-you-can-eat
buffet in the sky.

171
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,353
What? Listen, I'm going to
swing you out,

172
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,148
cut your ropes and drop you
safely to that landing below.

173
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,233
Wait, what?
That seems a tad risky.

174
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,693
Is there another plan
that doesn't involve

175
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,486
cutting a rope
over a 40-foot drop?

176
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,031
No time. We gotta get outta here
before they come back.

177
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,878
We need to go. Come on, Junior!

178
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,673
Wait here, Junior.
I'll be right back.

179
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,594
<i>I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.</i>

180
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:59,061
- You!
- Hey! Junior.

181
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:04,483
"Who is he?"
This is Vic. My "father."

182
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,734
Look, Junior,
I know how you might be upset.

183
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,694
Upset? Why would I be upset?

184
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,365
You only abandoned me
in an alley as a kitten.

185
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,450
I'm probably just overreacting!

186
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,005
Oh, no, not her.

187
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,259
Okay, follow me, Junior.
No, no, no.

188
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,844
You lost the privilege
of telling me

189
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,637
what to do a long time ago.

190
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:37,140
- Hello, Vic.
- Dang it!

191
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:42,312
Scare cam!
You should've seen your faces!

192
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,651
Okay, boys, show me!

193
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,695
<i>Hello, Vic.</i>

194
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:50,946
<i>Dang...</i>

195
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,159
Post that ASAP!

196
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:05,752
What? Hey, Jinx!
I haven't seen you since...

197
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:10,215
Well, no hard feelings
though, right?

198
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,677
I don't think so.

199
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,097
I'm a hugger!

200
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,224
Part of me
wants to be mad at her

201
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,351
for kidnapping us,
but you gotta love her energy.

202
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,228
Where are my manners?

203
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,814
Chop-chop, gentlemen!
Look alive!

204
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,164
Perfection.

205
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,333
You know, I was so delighted

206
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,503
that you accepted
my invitation here tonight.

207
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:49,046
Well, throwing us
in a burlap sack

208
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:50,214
wasn't exactly an Evite.

209
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:53,967
Vic, you're so quiet.
Are you feline sad?

210
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,595
Cat got your tongue?
Would you prefer a mew-mosa?

211
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,306
Excuse me,
how do you two know each other?

212
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:02,392
- Let me handle this, Junior.
- Don't "Junior" me.

213
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,854
You may call me Garfield,
Mr. Garfield, or G-Money.

214
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,189
Okay, whatever, no G-Money.

215
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:10,108
Anyway, can somebody
please tell me what is going on?

216
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,152
We really
don't need to get into...

217
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,403
I'll take this one.

218
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:19,868
What?

219
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:23,372
I'm from a small town
outside London

220
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,040
that you've probably
never heard of.

221
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:29,711
I scratched and clawed my way
through hard times...

222
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,923
to come here with one dream.

223
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,477
<i>I wanted to be seen.</i>

224
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:49,314
<i>I wanted to matter.</i>

225
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,903
<i>But I was a failure.</i>

226
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,280
The winner!

227
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,872
<i>And then I met Vic and his crew.</i>

228
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:09,501
<i>They were outcasts,
losers, thugs.</i>

229
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,963
<i>We didn't have much,
but we had each other.</i>

230
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,924
<i>We became a real family.</i>

231
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,553
Vic and family?
I know where this is goin'.

232
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:20,637
Excuse me,

233
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,265
<i>garçon,</i>
when might we expect appetizers?

234
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,351
- Perhaps an amuse-bouche?
- And then one night...

235
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,313
<i>We were about to make
our biggest score.</i>

236
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:32,858
<i>Enough milk
to last us for weeks.</i>

237
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:38,488
Vic!

238
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,492
Vic!

239
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,955
Jinx, I tried to come back
for you.

240
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,373
You have to know that.

241
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:51,877
- Yes, you get an "A" for effort.
- So, what happened next?

242
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:55,380
Imagine Alcatraz...
but smellier.

243
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,634
<i>It was cold. And lonely.</i>

244
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:02,971
<i>And stinky. So very stinky.
I can't overstate that enough.</i>

245
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,518
<i>But it gave me purpose.
I needed to get out.</i>

246
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,728
<i>I just needed help.</i>

247
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,078
So, your purpose
was to escape jail

248
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,704
and get involved with charities?

249
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,581
No. My purpose was...

250
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,792
revenge.

251
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,711
I see,
I went the other way with it.

252
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,630
I'm kidding.

253
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,841
Another cat
would be bent on revenge,

254
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:41,510
but I'm...
How would you put it?

255
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,928
Evolved, compassionate,

256
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:46,265
- and incredibly self-actualized.
- Bingo!

257
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,892
I had such trouble finding him

258
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,103
and when I discovered
you were his son,

259
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:54,147
I had no choice but to
kidnap you to lure him here.

260
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,149
No, listen, I totally get it.

261
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,735
It's all part of bein'
associated with Vic.

262
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:02,823
So, what do you need from him
to make this right?

263
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,366
I simply want him to pay back

264
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,076
the quart of milk
I lost that night

265
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:08,078
- and we'll call it even.
- I can do that.

266
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,288
What he can't do
is raise a child.

267
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:10,789
- Just one quart.
- Just one quart.

268
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:11,915
- Done.
- Done.

269
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,417
For every day
I was in the pound.

270
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,669
- What now?
- Nice twist. Well played.

271
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,212
How long were you
in the pound again?

272
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,339
Four years,
seven months and two days.

273
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,424
That long?

274
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:21,884
All right, I'm gonna do
the math here

275
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:24,845
in my brain.
The way you do that is...

276
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:28,307
Odie? 1,675 quarts of milk.

277
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:30,309
Exactly right, Odie.
We both came up with it

278
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:31,393
at the exact same time.

279
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:34,146
Where am I gonna find
that much milk?

280
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:36,190
Well, I suggest
you go back to the place

281
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,733
you double-crossed me.

282
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:42,070
- Lactose Farms.
- Wow. Well, good luck, Vic!

283
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:45,199
I'll leave you two to work out
the fine print.

284
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,284
We'll just see ourselves out.
Odie?

285
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,996
No. You're all going to do this.

286
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,414
What? Wait, why me?

287
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,208
He's the one who abandoned you.

288
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,668
Yes, but this is more
than a one-cat job.

289
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,212
Yeah, but I'm sure
Vic has a whole crew

290
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,214
of low-life cat burglars
he could ask.

291
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:01,757
I'm sure he does.

292
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,383
But if I'm being
completely honest,

293
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,093
seeing how miserable
you make one another

294
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,262
brings me endless satisfaction.

295
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,389
Well, thank you
for your honesty.

296
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,767
And if I don't go?

297
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:15,020
You can stay and have a playdate
with Roland and Nolan.

298
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,023
Okay, boys...
go play!

299
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,575
Ma'am, I think
this is an opportunity

300
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,536
to take a deep,
cleansing breath...

301
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:33,705
and repeat your
anger management mantra.

302
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,712
Anyone else have any objections?

303
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:44,049
Nope, I'm good.
Thanks for the opportunity.

304
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:48,262
Excellent!
Now, you boys have 72 hours.

305
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:53,725
Or else...

306
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,187
I can't believe
this is happening!

307
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:59,147
I don't see you for years
and when I do,

308
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,566
you pull me into
a life of crime!

309
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,568
I had this reunion playing
differently in my head too.

310
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:03,944
Well, that's the difference
between us,

311
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:06,154
because I never wanted
to see you again!

312
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,865
Now, I totally
understand your anger.

313
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:09,825
But if you give me
a chance to explain

314
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,493
you'll see I'm not the bad guy
you think I am.

315
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:14,454
A good guy doesn't leave
his kid in an alley!

316
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,206
- It wasn't like that.
- It was exactly like that!

317
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,708
No, it wasn't.

318
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,126
- Let me tell you what, Junior...
- No, no!

319
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,503
I don't wanna hear it!
This whole thing with Jinx?

320
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:24,756
This is your mess, not mine.
Come on, Odie.

321
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:27,676
Can't let you do that.

322
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:30,929
We'll be watching you.

323
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:32,181
Like a hawk.

324
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:43,609
Is today a Monday?

325
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,235
Because it feels
an awful lot like a Monday.

326
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,320
It's Thursday.

327
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,781
- Not to me, it's not!
- Look, I know this isn't ideal,

328
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,826
but we have to do this.
So, let's just try and make

329
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,746
- the best of our time together.
- Our time together?

330
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:57,998
What are you talkin' about?
Once we get this milk,

331
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:00,375
I want you out of my life.
Forever!

332
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,169
All right, just relax.

333
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:03,712
Lactose Farms ain't nothing

334
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:05,547
but a sleepy little
mom-and-pop dairy.

335
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,174
This will be a quick
grab and go.

336
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:08,550
You'll be back home
before you know it.

337
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:13,347
So, how do we even
get to Lactose Farms?

338
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:14,765
It's way out in the country.

339
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:15,974
You ever jumped a train?

340
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,352
I've never jumped.

341
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:21,522
Look, if jumpin' a train
is too hard, just say it.

342
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:23,649
- How hard could it be?
- Exactly!

343
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,069
This is gonna be fun.

344
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:30,906
Garfield?

345
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,991
Odie? Hello?

346
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:37,120
Garfield, how many times
have I told you

347
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,414
to close the refrigerator door?
Ga...

348
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,501
Wait, there's food on the floor.

349
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:47,422
He's never left food
on the floor. Garfield?

350
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,136
Garfield?
Garfield? Garfield?

351
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:56,348
Garfield? Garfield?
Garfield?

352
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,647
Our best shot at jumping
on the train is here.

353
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:05,440
Hold on a sec. I'm just
taking in the wind speed,

354
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,360
the direction of the sun,
and various angles.

355
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,529
Yes, I say we jump the train
from right here.

356
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:11,780
Didn't I just say that?

357
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,240
I've seen it on television
a million times.

358
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,659
- We'll need a 100 feet of rope.
- Uh-huh, rope. Yeah, okay.

359
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:16,785
- Great idea.
- Yep.

360
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,036
We'll throw the rope
over that branch

361
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,496
- right there.
- Over the branch. Got it.

362
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:23,041
Can you follow me? All right.
And then timing it just right,

363
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,502
we swing over
as the train passes by

364
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:27,671
and land on top of the car.

365
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,923
- Boom!
- Or, we can do this!

366
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,302
Odie, jump, boy!

367
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,108
Part of me wants to help him.

368
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,444
No. This is how he learns.

369
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:01,038
I don't know,
it's kind of pricey.

370
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:02,122
How does it handle?

371
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:04,875
I'll take it!

372
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:19,848
See? I told you
this was gonna be fun.

373
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:23,227
{\an8}You and I have
different definitions of fun.

374
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:28,273
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Finally! Hello!

375
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:30,067
<i>You've reached Find My Pet.</i>

376
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,860
<i>If your pet is lost,
we're here to help.</i>

377
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,821
Hi, yes! Great, okay.
My orange tabby and my dog

378
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,823
are both missing
and I need your help.

379
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:37,991
<i>Please listen carefully</i>

380
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,243
<i>as our menu options
have changed.</i>

381
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:40,327
- Okay.
<i>- If you'd like to hear</i>

382
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:41,411
<i>this call in Spanish...</i>

383
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:42,496
<i>- ...oprima número dos.</i>
- What?

384
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:43,789
<i>For Pig Latin,
ess-pray even-say.</i>

385
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:44,873
<i>For gibberish...</i>

386
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:47,209
Come on. What do I press
to talk to a real person?

387
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:49,002
<i>Your call is
very important to us.</i>

388
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:52,840
<i>There are 1,346 people
ahead of you.</i>

389
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,926
What?
Garfield, where are you?

390
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,684
Okay, Vic,
you gotta figure this out.

391
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,603
Jinx can't be trusted

392
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:10,941
and you gotta keep Junior safe!
You just gotta figure out a way

393
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:16,196
- to get him outta this.
- Tell me, is it a bur? It hurts.

394
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,782
You pulled my hair.

395
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:21,618
Is it a gnat? Is it a bug?
A bug?

396
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,706
Odie, Odie!

397
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:29,877
Okay.

398
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:36,550
You know what, Junior?

399
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,137
- This is gonna be good for you.
- What'll be good for me?

400
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:41,221
What we're doing.

401
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:42,723
We're about to steal
a truck full of milk

402
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:45,100
from a dairy to pay back
a deranged cat.

403
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,769
What part of that is going to be
good for me?

404
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,022
All of it!
You can't even imagine

405
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:51,690
the life lessons
you're gonna learn.

406
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,358
Oh, yeah? Name one.

407
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:55,569
Well, for starters,
you already know

408
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,362
how to get on a moving train.

409
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,452
I found it funny.

410
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:06,163
All I'm sayin'
is that to break into a dairy,

411
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:07,581
it's going to
take a few skills...

412
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:09,333
I'm guessing a rounded,
mush-filled,

413
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,293
overly pampered indoor cat
like you...

414
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,005
doesn't have.
So, we need to toughen you up.

415
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:18,383
Toughen me up?
Hey, I know tough, Vic.

416
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:20,552
You've obviously never been
in an Olive Garden

417
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:22,387
that's run out of breadsticks.

418
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:25,641
Anyway, I'm never gonna
need those skills

419
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,559
- you're talking about.
- But you'll have them.

420
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,520
I'm never gonna
break into a dairy

421
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,438
or anything else, ever again.

422
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,440
You are missing the point.

423
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,858
You're going to learn
to improvise,

424
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,443
think on your feet,
develop moves

425
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,154
that'll come in handy
out there in the real world!

426
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,156
I wouldn't be
in the "real world"

427
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,324
if it wasn't for you!

428
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:45,160
True. You'd still be hanging
upside down in the mall.

429
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,373
- No, I would be asleep at home!
- Missing out on life altogether.

430
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:53,460
Look, I'm just a dad trying to
teach his son some skills.

431
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,463
No, no, no.
You can't make up for five years

432
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:58,507
- of not being around.
- Yes, I can.

433
00:29:58,507 --> 00:29:59,925
- No, you can't.
- I think I can.

434
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:01,385
- In fact, you can't.
- Yes, I can!

435
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:03,971
- You really can't!
- With your attitude, I can.

436
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:08,016
Okay, whatever, "Dad."
Wow. Great lesson.

437
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:10,352
I'm done talking to you.

438
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:11,812
You do not know me,

439
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:13,647
you don't know
the first thing about me.

440
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:17,734
{\an8}I am not pampered.
I'm not anything you think I am!

441
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:25,492
Okay. I'm just gonna say

442
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:28,245
that blanket
is not the best idea.

443
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:30,539
Fantastic, thank you.
I'll take it from here.

444
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,586
Get them off! Get them off!

445
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:40,465
Get them off me!
What are you doin'?

446
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,556
- What did you do?
- Cedar chips.

447
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:51,059
Spiders hate 'em.
See? Another life skill learned.

448
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,227
I...

449
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:54,438
I think the words
you're looking for are...

450
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:56,064
"Thank you, Pops."

451
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:57,941
No, the word
I'm looking for is...

452
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,360
- Here's our stop!
- Really? Where?

453
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:07,492
Odie, you think
he'd see that coming.

454
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,263
Cheese!

455
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:30,891
- Take your picture.
- Yeah!

456
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,645
Yeah!

457
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:36,563
- Here you go!
- Yay!

458
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:51,411
Quaint. Just a simple little
"grab and go."

459
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,497
Okay. Okay, so they've done
a few upgrades

460
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:55,791
since I was last here.
Why being so dramatic?

461
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,584
All we have to do
is climb the fence...

462
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,575
Wait. Is that Otto?

463
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:31,159
- Who?
- Otto!

464
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:32,494
Of "Otto and Ethel."

465
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,746
No clue
who you're talkin' about.

466
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:37,082
He's one of the mascots
of Lactose Farms.

467
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,001
See? On the side of the barn?

468
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:42,129
I'll bet he knows
how to get into that place.

469
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:43,297
Leave him alone.

470
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:46,425
Seems to be in a period
of meditation... or depression.

471
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:47,593
Yes, he does.

472
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,263
This calls for tact,
sensitivity, and diplomacy.

473
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:53,724
Yeah? And where are we
supposed to get that?

474
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:55,893
I have it. In spades.

475
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:57,811
Watch!
Maybe you'll learn somethin'.

476
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:02,733
Excuse me, you're Otto, right?

477
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:08,655
I'm Garfield.

478
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,240
- A pleasure.
- Go away.

479
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,117
I just wanted to say
I am a huge fan.

480
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,619
I have eaten everything

481
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,037
that has a picture
of your face on it.

482
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:16,371
I'm not that guy anymore.

483
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,832
I even loved that recalled
provolone from a few years back.

484
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:20,000
- Junior, no.
- Yeah.

485
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,628
Anyways, here's the thing.
Me and my crew back there,

486
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:25,255
we're in a bit of a bind.
Got ourselves in a situation.

487
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:27,633
Long story short,
we could use your help.

488
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:30,719
You're a fan, huh?

489
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:34,515
- Yes! Big time.
- Then sing the jingle.

490
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:37,392
Well, I don't really
sing on command.

491
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:38,810
I'm not a circus animal.

492
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,729
- Sing it.
- Really?

493
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:45,692
- Sing it.
<i>- Lactose Farms, Lactose Farms</i>

494
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:48,570
<i>We've got milks, butters,
creams and cheeses</i>

495
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,572
- More spirit.
<i>- Much as you want</i>

496
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:51,949
<i>- As much as it pleases...</i>
- Livelier!

497
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:54,201
<i>Come and take a look
and see what we got</i>

498
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:56,245
<i>'Cause what we got
is a whole lotta lot</i>

499
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:04,086
<i>Tasty goodness is our motto
brought to you</i>

500
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:07,422
<i>By Ethel and Otto!</i>

501
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:10,592
What was that for?

502
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:11,927
I hate that jingle.

503
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:14,388
You could've just
told me to stop.

504
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,203
Let's go. Kids are waiting.

505
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:52,926
Odie, come back!

506
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:54,469
Leave him alone!
He might punch you!

507
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:09,067
Was that Ethel?

508
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,117
A few years back,

509
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:19,912
Old Man Lactose
was forced out of business.

510
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:25,167
The corporation that took over
separated me from my Ethel.

511
00:35:26,585 --> 00:35:29,254
<i>- Ethel!
- You are my day!</i>

512
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:30,839
<i>You are my night!</i>

513
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:35,219
{\an8}<i>I was put out to pasture.</i>

514
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,557
<i>She was put on display
as part of the tour.</i>

515
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,604
I tried to get in there

516
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:49,650
to break Ethel free...
but they stop me every time.

517
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:55,948
Now, I only see her six seconds,
twice a day.

518
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:57,866
We feel you, Otto.

519
00:35:57,866 --> 00:35:59,368
Come on, let's go, Junior.

520
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:01,119
We'll find another way
to break in there.

521
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,540
What could you possibly
want from that place?

522
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,667
You know,
a couple quarts of milk.

523
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,585
Couple thousand quarts.

524
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:10,087
Good luck.

525
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:12,005
We'll take any helpful hints
you have.

526
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,131
Pass.

527
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:15,384
I'm telling you,
it's a life-or-death situation.

528
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:18,387
Then I hope you've notified
your next of kin.

529
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:21,348
What if we can get Ethel out?

530
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,891
Or get you a commemorative pin?

531
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:29,147
Where are we gonna find
a commemorative pin?

532
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:32,401
Now, pay attention.

533
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:34,528
Here's the perimeter
of the plant.

534
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:36,864
And here are the two places
you need to go.

535
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:40,659
First, the truck
with your milk is back here.

536
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:44,371
And this delicate buttercup
is my Ethel.

537
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:47,165
My North Star,
and reason for living

538
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:51,962
is being kept by those
barbarians in... a petting zoo.

539
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:53,338
Located here.

540
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:57,342
This cricket represents
the electrical room...

541
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:59,428
this snail,
the refrigeration room...

542
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:02,014
this toadstool
is the loading dock

543
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:04,308
where you'll find the keys
to the trucks.

544
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:05,642
Wait, what's the pinecone?

545
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:07,895
The pinecone is the cheese
and butter room.

546
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:11,607
- Cheese is my love language.
- Now, for this briefing,

547
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:13,734
I've done a quick reading
of your personalities

548
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:16,570
and have chosen tokens
to represent each of you.

549
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,947
You are the majestic bullfrog.

550
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:24,244
Yeah, that feels right.

551
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:27,247
You are the curious
and clever chipmunk.

552
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,124
- And you...
- Wait for it...

553
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,543
...are roadkill.

554
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:37,591
What? No, I get it.
That's a good one, Otto!

555
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,343
Giving your new
best friend roadkill.

556
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:42,054
Seriously, though,
what's my real token?

557
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,597
That is your real token.

558
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:46,141
Now, if you have any chance
of succeeding...

559
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,143
Wait, can I... Excuse me, can I
switch to something living?

560
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:50,562
- Like the snail or the cricket?
- You should've spoken up sooner.

561
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:52,814
At this point, it would be
too confusing to switch.

562
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:55,067
Sooner? But you just told me
this five seconds ago.

563
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:57,361
- Come on, Roadkill, focus.
- Really?

564
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:59,571
You give Vic
the majestic bullfrog.

565
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,865
You give Odie the curious
and clever chipmunk...

566
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,660
and then you give me,
your new bff, roadkill?

567
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,745
I mean, it feels disrespectful,
not gonna lie.

568
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:08,288
What makes you think he's dead?

569
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:10,249
My eyes.
I have eyes and can see.

570
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,501
It's a possum.
They're masters at playing dead.

571
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,294
Well then,
little Daniel Day-Possum here

572
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:15,587
should do Shakespeare
in the Park!

573
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:16,797
Things aren't always
what they seem.

574
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:18,173
You're right.
But in this case, they are.

575
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:19,925
What's the big deal?
Possums play dead.

576
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:21,468
Do they, Otto?
Do they play dead?

577
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:23,136
Do possums play possum,
is that what they do?

578
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:25,013
Yes. Possums are very clever.

579
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:26,181
Yeah, I'm sure he was

580
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:27,850
until the day
he ate a pick-up truck!

581
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:30,602
Just ignore him.
Please, continue.

582
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:32,396
I'll just put this back
where you had it.

583
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,274
The straightest line
to the loading dock

584
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:38,235
is through the snail here,
then the cricket, there,

585
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:40,988
cut through the toadstool
and onto the rock.

586
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,031
Each of these rooms
have their own set

587
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,033
- of unique challenges.
- Well, why can't we just go

588
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:46,159
straight through the pinecone?

589
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,786
You don't want to
go through the pinecone.

590
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:49,371
Looks like the straightest shot
is through the pinecone.

591
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:51,206
You like walking
with those feet, do you?

592
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:54,084
You a fan of unimaginable
pain and misery?

593
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:56,253
Then go through the pinecone.

594
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:58,255
Stay away from the pinecone.
Got it.

595
00:38:58,255 --> 00:38:59,965
Once you're inside
the facility...

596
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:03,093
<i>You will enter
the electrical room.</i>

597
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,470
<i>There you will locate
the air vent.</i>

598
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:09,641
<i>Pop the grate and climb up.</i>

599
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:17,399
<i>Then, you'll crawl through
a maze of vents and drop down...</i>

600
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,818
<i>to the refrigeration room.</i>

601
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:22,613
<i>Next, you will need
to hurl your body</i>

602
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:25,407
<i>over a 30-foot drop...
to a series of hand rungs.</i>

603
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:28,827
<i>You'll propel yourselves
hand-over-hand...</i>

604
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:32,080
<i>and drop down
directly into a loading dock.</i>

605
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:36,251
{\an8}<i>From there, you'll locate
the keys to the milk truck.</i>

606
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:39,546
<i>Drive that truck to the west
pasture of the complex,</i>

607
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:40,797
<i>cut the lock on the gate.</i>

608
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:43,509
<i>And find the closest thing
we have</i>

609
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:46,386
<i>to an angel here on earth.</i>

610
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:52,643
<i>You'll escort my sweet Ethel
onto the truck</i>

611
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:54,853
<i>and drive her to freedom.</i>

612
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,398
It's going to take mad skills

613
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:02,027
to get that milk,
and free my dear, sweet Ethel.

614
00:40:02,027 --> 00:40:04,363
Clearly, this one is qualified
for the mission.

615
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:08,200
But, I have some serious doubts
here about all of...

616
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,328
- this.
- He's pointing to you, Roadkill.

617
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:14,164
Let's get to work.

618
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:17,292
Stupid roadkill.

619
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:19,670
Hey! I'm workin' here!

620
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:23,090
Definitely a Monday.

621
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,634
<i>Your call is
fairly important to us.</i>

622
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:27,594
<i>If you've lost a cat,
please press one.</i>

623
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:29,096
<i>- If your cat is orange...</i>
- Yeah.

624
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:30,347
<i>...please press two.</i>

625
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:32,391
<i>This doesn't really
accomplish anything...</i>

626
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:33,725
<i>but gives you the false sense</i>

627
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:35,143
<i>that we're engaged with you.</i>

628
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:42,067
All right, gentlemen,
I've made a list of skills...

629
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,862
...that you'll need
to master in order

630
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:47,489
to break into Lactose Farms.
Number one,

631
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:49,741
develop lightning-fast reflexes.

632
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:51,451
You tell Garfield
there's a plate of pasta

633
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:52,578
on the other side of that wall

634
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:54,830
and you will see
lightning reflexes.

635
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,957
Yeah, no, no, no.
Depends what kind of pasta.

636
00:40:56,957 --> 00:41:00,377
This pebble represents danger
you may encounter.

637
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:02,963
You need to grab it,
before it grabs you.

638
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,089
It grabs me?

639
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:05,883
Snatch the pebble from my hand.

640
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:06,967
Too slow!

641
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:08,760
What was that for?

642
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,721
Being able to grab
the pebble could be

643
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,723
the difference
between life and death.

644
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:14,516
All right,
let me try that again.

645
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:17,144
Got it!

646
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:19,104
Now what was that for?

647
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,731
It's never
just about the pebble.

648
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:22,399
Come on, Junior,
everyone knows that.

649
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:25,194
Your head's got to be
on a swivel at all times.

650
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:26,320
Gotta be ready for anything.

651
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,155
I was ready.
He changed the game.

652
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,324
Sounds like
someone's making excuses!

653
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:35,329
And what was that
about being ready for anything?

654
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:36,914
You were distracting me!

655
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:38,707
Might I suggest putting
your head on a swivel?

656
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:39,958
You should have
seen that coming.

657
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,919
Toes on the line!
Guard your grill!

658
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,045
Cover your stomach!

659
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:45,172
There are surprises
around every corner

660
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,758
at Lactose Farms.
You need to stay alert!

661
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:50,177
Too slow! A baby could have
seen that coming!

662
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:53,305
Too slow!
Too slow!

663
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,183
Too slow!

664
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:59,102
You'll never make it
through Lactose Farms

665
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:00,646
if you can't survive
this training!

666
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:01,855
Are you for real?

667
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,565
What kinda dairy is this?

668
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:06,485
The kind of dairy that requires
teamwork to survive!

669
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:08,987
Danger could be
anywhere, gentlemen!

670
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:12,491
You've got to be ready
to outrun it.

671
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:18,080
Here comes the pain!

672
00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:21,041
- Left, right, left, right.
- You're confusing me!

673
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:38,267
I think I'm gonna need rehab.

674
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:44,523
If this is going to work,

675
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:46,859
these two have to be
on the same page.

676
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,360
I'm out of ideas.

677
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,528
You got any?

678
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:54,157
Can't believe I'm out
in the middle of nowhere

679
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:55,993
getting beaten up
against my will

680
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:58,120
by a former celebrity steer.

681
00:42:58,871 --> 00:43:02,708
Odie? Will you tell my son
to please stop whining?

682
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,209
Odie, can you tell Vic

683
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:05,752
that I collapsed
on this tree first

684
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:07,296
and that he needs
to find another one?

685
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:09,673
Odie, can you tell my son

686
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:12,092
that I will gladly
find another one

687
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:14,052
when I get the feeling
back in my legs?

688
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:15,929
Odie, can you tell my father

689
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,389
that he wouldn't be
lying in pain

690
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:18,473
if he led a better life

691
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:20,017
and didn't create
problems for himself?

692
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:23,604
Could you please
inform my son

693
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:26,190
that he should focus
on fixing his own issues?

694
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,649
Odie? What?

695
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:30,319
Odie? What'd you do?

696
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:33,530
After all
I've let you do for me.

697
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,116
What is this?

698
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:39,661
Hey, watch it!

699
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:46,001
What's the problem, Vic?
Is this bothering you?

700
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:51,965
No.
In fact, I don't mind it at all!

701
00:43:53,926 --> 00:43:55,636
I don't mind it either.

702
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:02,226
I could watch this all day.

703
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:04,144
- Stop pulling.
- I'm not, you're pulling!

704
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:06,688
If I was pulling,
you would know it!

705
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:08,273
Why does everything you do

706
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:09,566
always end up hurting me?

707
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:10,943
Hurt you?

708
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:13,862
All I ever did
was try to help you.

709
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:15,656
You sure?
'Cause every time you're around,

710
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:16,949
it ends up with me in pain.

711
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:19,660
Odie! These ropes
are not funny anymore!

712
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:24,373
Maybe, if you were a little more
open to seeing me,

713
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:26,041
things might be
better between us.

714
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:29,086
You do remember you were the one
who left me in an alley, right?

715
00:44:29,086 --> 00:44:31,088
You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

716
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:33,298
Then please, enlighten me.

717
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:37,803
This is about to get real.

718
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:39,388
That's right.
You're normally never around

719
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:40,764
to actually defend yourself.

720
00:44:40,764 --> 00:44:42,975
No back door
to slink out of this time.

721
00:44:42,975 --> 00:44:45,310
First, you abandon me,
then years later,

722
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,396
you pull me
into a life of crime.

723
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:50,440
Well, classic "Father of
the Year" stuff, "Dad."

724
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,817
You know,
why would I ever think

725
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:53,443
that seeing you
could be anything

726
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:54,695
other than a train wreck?

727
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:57,614
I did not leave you
in that alley!

728
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:58,740
You did!

729
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,659
You told me you'd come
right back. You never did!

730
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:04,454
No. That is not what happened.

731
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:07,457
Please! You were probably
on the run from someone

732
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:10,085
- like Jinx and I was in the way.
- No.

733
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:14,464
No, that night...

734
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:17,759
<i>That night was different.</i>

735
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:45,037
Hey! Shoo, shoo! Get outta here!

736
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:22,908
Wait here, Junior.
I'll be right back.

737
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:30,332
Hey, get outta here.

738
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:33,168
Hey, how you doing? Yeah.
I had to shoo a cat.

739
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:35,879
Yeah, yeah,
diggin' in the trash. Yeah.

740
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:37,381
So, what'cha up to now, huh?

741
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:40,300
Still takin' it easy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

742
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:46,306
Oh, no, you're kiddin'. Really?
Yeah, yeah.

743
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:48,892
It's been raining here
for a while now. Yeah, yeah.

744
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:52,312
Yeah! I'll see you then.
Okay, bye.

745
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:39,002
I never knew.

746
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,088
I know, how could you?

747
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:43,841
Why didn't you ever come
visit me?

748
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:48,971
I did. Million times I...

749
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:51,974
came to knock on your door

750
00:48:51,974 --> 00:48:54,726
and I'd see what a great life
you had with Jon.

751
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:56,019
So, I just...

752
00:48:57,187 --> 00:48:59,231
thought it was better
if I kept my distance.

753
00:49:00,148 --> 00:49:03,026
I sense a positive breakthrough
in your relationship.

754
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:04,736
Am I wrong?

755
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:08,866
Good.
After an extensive evaluation,

756
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:10,659
I have concluded
that you two are,

757
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:12,619
in fact, ready to move forward

758
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:14,246
- with this mission.
- We are?

759
00:49:14,246 --> 00:49:17,541
- How is that even possible?
- Mathematically, it isn't.

760
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:20,043
But given your present levels
of incompetence

761
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:22,504
and overall lack
of basic skills,

762
00:49:22,504 --> 00:49:25,591
I have determined
it would take roughly...

763
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:28,844
seventeen years to get you both
properly ready for this job.

764
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:30,470
And since we have...

765
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:34,016
less than 48 hours,
you've passed.

766
00:49:35,267 --> 00:49:36,268
{\an8}Congratulations.

767
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:22,397
She's really losin' it.

768
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:27,194
Yes, what is it?

769
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:29,071
They're ready to rob the dairy.

770
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:31,657
Perfect.

771
00:50:32,366 --> 00:50:35,911
Everything is going to plan.
Now, it's time to make a call.

772
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:40,541
Excuse me, you keep that thing
in your folds?

773
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:43,836
That is so disgusting.
You. You dial the number

774
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:45,003
and put me on speaker!

775
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:48,799
<i>Hello?</i>

776
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:51,218
- Hello? Lactose Farms?
<i>- How may I help you?</i>

777
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:52,886
It's come to my attention

778
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:54,429
that there'll be
an attempt to rob

779
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:56,890
one of your
dairy trucks tomorrow.

780
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:59,810
It's not important who I am
or how I came to know this.

781
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:02,688
Just think of me
as a concerned citizen

782
00:51:02,688 --> 00:51:04,106
intent on fulfilling my

783
00:51:04,106 --> 00:51:06,275
civic responsibility
as well as...

784
00:51:06,275 --> 00:51:08,569
<i>Meow, meow, meow.</i>

785
00:51:12,072 --> 00:51:13,073
Chief?

786
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:20,330
- We may have a situation.
- Well, okay then.

787
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:22,791
Let's go have a look-see.

788
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:25,085
<i>Meow, meow, meow.</i>

789
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:29,173
This is the third time
they've called.

790
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:31,967
It just sounds like some cat
prank callin' us.

791
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,636
If it were a dog barking,

792
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:36,513
I'd be on board for a prank.

793
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:38,891
Them dogs are born for mischief,
they just are.

794
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:42,561
Not cats. Oh, no.

795
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:45,314
Cats mean business.

796
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:54,364
<i>Meow, meow, meow.</i>

797
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:55,949
<i>"I repeat,
there will be an attempt</i>

798
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:57,951
<i>"to make off with one of your
milk trucks tomorrow.</i>

799
00:51:57,951 --> 00:52:00,037
<i>"I suggest you take
appropriate measures</i>

800
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:02,623
<i>"to prevent this brazen thievery
from occurring.</i>

801
00:52:02,623 --> 00:52:04,750
<i>"Okay, I'm done.
Hang up the phone.</i>

802
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,252
<i>"Ha, ha.
What an evil genius I am."</i>

803
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:10,839
Well, then, still seem
like a prank to ya?

804
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:14,301
- That last part did a little.
- What's our next move, Chief?

805
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:17,846
Our next move is for me
to go back to my office

806
00:52:17,846 --> 00:52:20,057
and formulate an ingenious plan.

807
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:23,519
And you go get my car waxed.

808
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:26,772
Well, well, well,

809
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:29,316
would you look at that,
Margie Malone?

810
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:31,735
We're having company tomorrow.

811
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:35,447
I guess I better take out
my finest china

812
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:40,202
{\an8}to serve a heapin' plate...
of justice.

813
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:49,419
What are those for?

814
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:52,506
For us to communicate
once you're inside...

815
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:54,883
the belly of the beast.

816
00:52:56,844 --> 00:53:00,264
Okay. Don't we need something
more like radio headsets?

817
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:04,017
Indoor cat. These are better.

818
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:05,727
It just feels like Bluetooth
would be better.

819
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:06,979
These are better than Bluetooth.

820
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:08,981
These are better than Bluetooth?

821
00:53:08,981 --> 00:53:10,399
They're equal.

822
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:13,151
And I don't have to pay
for the brand.

823
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:21,034
Gold Eagle to Chipmunk.
Do you copy?

824
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:24,079
Of course, you can hear him.

825
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,664
He's standing
three feet away from you.

826
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:29,001
I see you sprung
for the binoculars.

827
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:31,753
Now, we just need to find...

828
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:35,299
a way in.

829
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:37,009
Anyone ever told you
that you take

830
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:38,677
a lot of dramatic pauses
when you speak?

831
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:43,098
Yes.

832
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:48,729
Hey, wait up!

833
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:52,357
- Look at that!
- Bingo.

834
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:57,070
{\an8}Hello, everyone!
And welcome to the one

835
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,740
{\an8}and only Lactose Farms!

836
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:01,992
If you will all
gather around me,

837
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:03,368
we'll begin our tour

838
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:05,162
{\an8}and head into the heart
of the farm.

839
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,623
{\an8}I know you're here.

840
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:11,710
I can feel it.
Show yourself.

841
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:15,088
<i>Today you will discover
the answers</i>

842
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:16,590
<i>to all of your
dairy questions,</i>

843
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,801
<i>including the most asked
dairy question of all time,</i>

844
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:21,720
<i>are curds the whey?</i>

845
00:54:22,638 --> 00:54:25,432
<i>Bullfrog, Chipmunk,
Roadkill, do you copy?</i>

846
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:27,726
Are you kidding me?
They actually work?

847
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:29,102
You should take this to
<i>Shark Tank.</i>

848
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:31,605
<i>Now, remember,
the only way to get the keys</i>

849
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:34,316
<i>to the milk truck
and free Ethel undetected</i>

850
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:36,902
<i>is by sticking to the path
I mapped out for you.</i>

851
00:54:36,902 --> 00:54:41,031
<i>If you deviate from that path,
you will trigger security</i>

852
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:43,242
<i>and all bets are off.
Understood?</i>

853
00:54:43,242 --> 00:54:45,118
All right, look alive.

854
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:46,620
The electrical access door

855
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,372
should be coming up
on your left.

856
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:49,748
Okay, this way!

857
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,709
Hey, hey, look! There it is!

858
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:58,465
Okay, we're in.

859
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:00,509
<i>Continue through
and locate the air vent</i>

860
00:55:00,509 --> 00:55:01,802
<i>at the end of the hallway.</i>

861
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:05,013
<i>That will take you
to the refrigeration room.</i>

862
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:08,934
<i>Factory workers,
your 15-minute break begins now.</i>

863
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,448
Your feet need a deep rinse.

864
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,624
- What's the hold up, Junior?
- How do you get through this?

865
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:35,502
- You're bigger than me.
- Am I?

866
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:38,255
- Yes!
- Well, the vent doesn't agree.

867
00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:40,674
- Try sucking in your gut.
- I am.

868
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:42,176
Try sucking in your butt
and your gut.

869
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:11,121
Bullfrog, what's happening now?

870
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:16,335
We fell out of a vent...
into a room that looks like

871
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:19,505
- it's full of heavy machinery.
<i>- Son of a cud.</i>

872
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:22,883
<i>You're in the pinecone.</i>

873
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:29,765
Jiminy Davis!
The perp is a cat!

874
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:31,808
And this one looks like it could
eat us out of business.

875
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:34,937
Vic, Vic!
Look, there's the loading dock.

876
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:37,648
- No! Junior! Don't move.
- What? Why?

877
00:56:37,648 --> 00:56:40,025
We're in the middle
of the pinecone!

878
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:42,319
Otto told us
to stay out of the pinecone.

879
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,614
Stop. There's no pinecone.
Otto's a bit of a worrywart.

880
00:56:45,614 --> 00:56:47,366
I can walk to the loading dock
from here.

881
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,201
No...

882
00:56:49,868 --> 00:56:50,953
Junior!

883
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:58,752
Cheddar.

884
00:56:58,752 --> 00:57:01,004
Probably one of my top 26
favorite cheeses.

885
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:04,800
What do you think happens
when that gets to zero?

886
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:10,013
<i>Bullfrog, what's happening now?</i>

887
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:12,808
Roadkill got carried away
into the pinecone!

888
00:57:12,808 --> 00:57:14,852
Listen to me.
You have to carry on

889
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:16,436
with the mission.
Get to the loading dock

890
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:18,272
before the workers
return from their break

891
00:57:18,272 --> 00:57:20,148
or you'll miss your only chance
to get that truck.

892
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:27,197
No, no, no.
No, no, no!

893
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:31,201
<i>Shred sequence initiated.</i>

894
00:57:39,918 --> 00:57:41,962
Odie! Thanks, buddy,

895
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:44,214
but I'm pretty full
from the cheddar.

896
00:57:44,214 --> 00:57:45,674
Jump off.

897
00:57:45,674 --> 00:57:47,134
Yeah, yeah, good idea.

898
00:57:56,143 --> 00:57:57,895
Good. He's safe.

899
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:03,150
Hang on. Wait. Where am I going?

900
00:58:04,234 --> 00:58:08,030
Fondue. Fondue!

901
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:49,905
Junior.

902
00:58:54,326 --> 00:58:58,288
Hot, hot, hot! Hot!

903
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,667
Junior!

904
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,760
That was too close even for me.

905
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:15,931
Thanks.

906
00:59:15,931 --> 00:59:18,225
I couldn't let you
have all the fun.

907
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:19,393
<i>- Workers...</i>
- What?

908
00:59:19,393 --> 00:59:21,395
<i>...your break ends
in five minutes.</i>

909
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,566
Okay, Otto,
we're in the loading dock.

910
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:26,900
Where are the keys?

911
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,570
<i>They should be hanging
on a pegboard on the far wall.</i>

912
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:32,072
What do you mean
we have a problem?

913
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:35,200
- Pegboard's empty!
<i>- Empty?</i>

914
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:38,704
Now would you look at this?

915
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:43,083
Three misguided stray pets
trying to steal a truck o' milk.

916
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:46,420
Never a dull moment
at this dairy, is there, Margie?

917
00:59:47,254 --> 00:59:49,047
Well, you're looking for these,
aren't ya?

918
00:59:49,047 --> 00:59:50,716
Well, here you go then.

919
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:57,264
So, how's this
gonna play out, fellas?

920
00:59:57,264 --> 00:59:59,683
The easy way or the hard way?

921
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:02,394
And just so you know,
I'm up for either.

922
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:07,024
- Follow my lead.
- What?

923
01:00:15,574 --> 01:00:16,617
Who's next then?

924
01:00:18,118 --> 01:00:20,120
Otto, a security guard
has the truck keys!

925
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,456
Crazy eyes?
Tragic sense of fashion?

926
01:00:22,456 --> 01:00:23,624
Yeah. How did you know?

927
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:24,833
Marge Malone.

928
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:27,878
<i>- Ethel!
- Otto!</i>

929
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:29,838
She's not just my nemesis,

930
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:31,965
she's also my enemy.

931
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:33,300
Love to hear about it,
but right now,

932
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,010
- what do we do?
- Get those keys.

933
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:37,137
I'll create a distraction
so you can get out of there.

934
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,890
Come here, you!

935
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:51,527
Did you see that?
That's indoor cat style!

936
01:01:01,078 --> 01:01:02,120
No, no, no.

937
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,414
You're not getting away.
I've already called the pound.

938
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:07,167
Your days of thievery end today.

939
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:09,920
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

940
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:16,343
{\an8}<i>Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

941
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:17,636
Otto.

942
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:22,182
<i>Attempted perimeter breach.
Attempted perimeter breach.</i>

943
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:26,979
- Junior, sorry about this.
- Sorry? For what?

944
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:32,067
Vic?

945
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:41,660
What are you doing?

946
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:46,790
Vic! Don't you go.

947
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,041
Vic!

948
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:50,836
Please!

949
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:58,510
Send security
to the loading dock.

950
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:09,855
Otto!

951
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:15,944
You do not want to try me
today, mister.

952
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:29,041
Get him!

953
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:12,793
Welcome back... Victor.

954
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,549
Hey, Jinx.

955
01:03:19,258 --> 01:03:21,802
Why are you here?
I was bringing this to you.

956
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:24,930
Were you? Really?

957
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,891
Yeah, of course I was.
That's what we agreed to, right?

958
01:03:31,812 --> 01:03:36,733
- So, you and me square now?
- Not quite.

959
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:39,403
There's still the matter
of those five years

960
01:03:39,403 --> 01:03:40,779
I lost because of you.

961
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:43,574
What?
But I thought this settled that.

962
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:49,788
It was never about the milk.
It was about you getting caught

963
01:03:49,788 --> 01:03:53,041
trying to steal it
and being sent to the pound

964
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:54,960
like I was.

965
01:03:55,752 --> 01:03:59,131
You see, Vic,
I needed you to suffer

966
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:02,551
like I did.

967
01:04:04,428 --> 01:04:05,929
I see.

968
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:07,556
And I'm guessing
you have an idea

969
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:09,516
about how that should happen.

970
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:13,395
As a matter of fact, I do.

971
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:22,321
I can't believe he did that.

972
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:28,243
He ran out, and he left me.
Again.

973
01:04:29,453 --> 01:04:30,996
I thought he'd changed,
but it was...

974
01:04:32,122 --> 01:04:33,373
it was a lie.

975
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:35,417
All of it.

976
01:04:40,506 --> 01:04:42,424
How could I have been so stupid?

977
01:04:47,596 --> 01:04:51,225
Come on, kid.
Don't beat yourself up.

978
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,103
Vic, man,
we've all been burned by Vic.

979
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:57,564
Yeah, that's right.
Burned every cat I know.

980
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:01,860
Yeah, the one thing
about Vic you can count on

981
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:04,696
- is that you can't count on him.
- Tell me about it.

982
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:06,823
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll tell you about it.

983
01:05:06,823 --> 01:05:10,327
Long story short, we all used
to run in a pack

984
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:12,788
until we had to kick him
out the crew.

985
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:16,416
Like I said,
couldn't count on him.

986
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:17,751
Sounds about right.

987
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:19,586
He'd leave
in the middle of a job

988
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:21,129
just to go see his kid.

989
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:24,550
Yeah, he said
he wanted to check up on him.

990
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:26,552
Make sure he was doing okay.

991
01:05:26,552 --> 01:05:29,346
But get this,
he'd never actually visit.

992
01:05:29,346 --> 01:05:30,889
He'd just sit across the street

993
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:33,267
from his kid's house
in a giant oak tree.

994
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:35,811
- That never happened.
- He'd watch that kid eat...

995
01:05:35,811 --> 01:05:37,229
- and eat and eat...
- ...and eat...

996
01:05:37,229 --> 01:05:40,399
- He put a notch in the bark...
- ...and eat, and eat, and eat.

997
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:43,151
- ...every time he was there.
- Yeah. Sure, he did.

998
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:46,822
He'd go every Sunday night,
rain or shine.

999
01:05:46,822 --> 01:05:48,365
Said that it was his kid's...

1000
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:51,034
...family dinner night.

1001
01:05:56,081 --> 01:05:57,916
Okay, hate to tell you guys...

1002
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:01,920
I guarantee
that never happened. Okay?

1003
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,257
You all fell for another one of
Vic's lies. We all have.

1004
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:08,051
Because that's
what he does best.

1005
01:06:13,223 --> 01:06:15,184
Odie? Odie!
How did you get out?

1006
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:18,812
Quick, pick the lock on my cage.
Garfield, there you are!

1007
01:06:18,812 --> 01:06:21,440
Jon! Take me away from all this.

1008
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,650
You can't imagine
what I've been through.

1009
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,652
- You want this one too?
- Yes, I do.

1010
01:06:25,652 --> 01:06:26,945
- I was hung upside down.
- You sure he's yours?

1011
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:28,405
He didn't have a tag.

1012
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:30,240
{\an8}- I jumped a train.
- Yeah. He has a tag.

1013
01:06:31,033 --> 01:06:34,119
{\an8}I have a collar and a tag?
How long have I had those?

1014
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:36,079
{\an8}Okay. I'm just gonna
need you to hold.

1015
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,790
I will not hold!
I am done holding!

1016
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:42,586
The Jon who was on hold is dead.
Do you understand?

1017
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:47,508
That's right. I'm back, baby!

1018
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,346
I was just talking about you,
wasn't I?

1019
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:56,934
I've missed you too.

1020
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:07,402
Pooky!

1021
01:07:10,155 --> 01:07:12,658
I have a lot to tell you.
You're never gonna believe it.

1022
01:07:13,492 --> 01:07:16,036
Crazy stuff happened.
I slept outside, twice!

1023
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:17,246
I know. Me.

1024
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:19,623
And I got you
this commemorative pin.

1025
01:07:20,624 --> 01:07:22,167
Dinner time!

1026
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:23,252
Talk later.

1027
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:42,521
Say when.

1028
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:45,232
Never, Jon.
Bury me in cheese.

1029
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:51,363
I have two more in the freezer.
Let me know when you want 'em.

1030
01:07:51,363 --> 01:07:52,614
I'm gonna go check on dessert.

1031
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:55,701
I apologize in advance.

1032
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:58,287
The eating you're about to see
will not be pretty

1033
01:07:58,287 --> 01:07:59,788
and if you have
young children,

1034
01:07:59,788 --> 01:08:01,832
this would be a good time
for them to leave the room.

1035
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,598
<i>He'd just sit across the street
from his kid's house</i>

1036
01:08:17,598 --> 01:08:19,140
<i>in a giant oak tree.</i>

1037
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:43,332
I know, I know.
We're coming back.

1038
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,542
I just need to check
something out first.

1039
01:09:07,898 --> 01:09:09,483
<i>He put a notch in the bark...</i>

1040
01:09:11,318 --> 01:09:12,944
<i>every time he was there.</i>

1041
01:09:30,127 --> 01:09:31,921
"He left a notch."

1042
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:35,676
Yeah, right.

1043
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:19,094
He was here.

1044
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,346
He saw me grow up.

1045
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:27,144
Wow, that really stings.

1046
01:10:27,144 --> 01:10:29,271
I don't know
why I didn't think it would.

1047
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:30,606
Give me a second.

1048
01:10:32,566 --> 01:10:33,650
Vic loves us!

1049
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:36,069
Me first, of course,
but then you too!

1050
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:42,075
But me, a lot, and first!
Wait, but if he loves me, us,

1051
01:10:42,075 --> 01:10:45,245
why would he let me, us,
get captured at the dairy?

1052
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:47,623
Unless, he wanted

1053
01:10:47,623 --> 01:10:49,082
- us to get captured!
- Hey!

1054
01:10:49,082 --> 01:10:50,167
- Yes!
- Hey, watch it!

1055
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:52,669
He knew that Jinx wasn't gonna
let him off the hook.

1056
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:55,422
{\an8}But if we got caught,
we'd get sent to the pound

1057
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:58,425
{\an8}and Jon would come to get us!
Don't you see, Odie?

1058
01:10:58,425 --> 01:11:01,053
- He was trying to save us!
- Losers!

1059
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:04,389
We have to go save my dad.

1060
01:11:05,098 --> 01:11:08,143
And here's
your favorite dessert,

1061
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:10,812
Mount Candy-toa!

1062
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:13,106
Guys?

1063
01:11:18,195 --> 01:11:19,530
Come on!

1064
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:30,332
What is this?

1065
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:46,932
Half a star for Mamma Leoni's?

1066
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:49,434
She's a monster.

1067
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:53,272
She's gonna tie him up...

1068
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:55,232
take him on a train...

1069
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:58,652
She's going to throw him off
the Mile High Bridge!

1070
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:00,988
We're gonna need help.
Who can we call?

1071
01:12:05,284 --> 01:12:06,451
You've got
a lot of waxy buildup.

1072
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:07,744
What's your Q-tip routine?

1073
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:09,705
You're right, you're right.

1074
01:12:09,705 --> 01:12:11,790
We can deal
with that situation later.

1075
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:14,668
Hello? Hello?
Is anyone there? Hello?

1076
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:19,590
<i>Get off the line.</i>

1077
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:21,550
<i>This acorn
is for emergency use only.</i>

1078
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:24,469
Otto! Otto, please, listen.

1079
01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:26,680
I wanna make good
on our original deal,

1080
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,683
but I need a favor first.

1081
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:36,815
Otto, are you still there or
are you taking a dramatic pause?

1082
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:40,903
<i>I'm listening.</i>

1083
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:47,951
You know, Vic,

1084
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:51,622
you only have yourself to blame
for this.

1085
01:12:53,332 --> 01:12:55,459
Right. Look,

1086
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:58,128
there's got to be some way
for me to make this right.

1087
01:12:58,128 --> 01:13:00,255
I mean, I know
we can think of somethin'.

1088
01:13:00,255 --> 01:13:04,009
There is, and you will.

1089
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:18,398
So, once I get on the train...

1090
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:19,983
I untie Vic and we jump off

1091
01:13:19,983 --> 01:13:21,527
right as
the train gets to the bridge.

1092
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:23,654
Correct. Chipmunk
will be waiting for you.

1093
01:13:25,656 --> 01:13:27,032
<i>Confirm your status, Chipmunk.</i>

1094
01:13:29,034 --> 01:13:31,245
If you don't jump right as
the train gets to the bridge,

1095
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:32,412
you'll miss the net.

1096
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:35,582
Got it. It's getting close.

1097
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:37,751
Have you considered
throwing a rope over a branch

1098
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:39,795
and just swinging
onto the passing train instead?

1099
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:40,879
You watch too much TV.

1100
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:42,005
I've never watched TV.

1101
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:44,383
Well, this way is much better
than your rope idea.

1102
01:13:44,383 --> 01:13:45,968
Better than the versatile,
reliable rope?

1103
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:48,262
Look, I've studied the science.
I know what I'm doing.

1104
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:50,681
And you think you can battle
these villains on your own?

1105
01:13:50,681 --> 01:13:53,559
Oh yeah. I have a plan. Odie?

1106
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,102
<i>Make the order.</i>

1107
01:13:58,105 --> 01:13:59,731
Now get ready to fling me

1108
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:01,859
in the direction
of that moving train.

1109
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:08,782
Get ready.

1110
01:14:10,701 --> 01:14:12,578
If I don't make it back...

1111
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:15,289
tell my story. Now!

1112
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:19,042
Roadkill! You're too high!
You're gonna miss it!

1113
01:14:19,042 --> 01:14:20,836
No, no, this is how you do it!

1114
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:22,379
It's called
the ricochet approach!

1115
01:14:27,509 --> 01:14:28,802
It won't be long now.

1116
01:14:28,927 --> 01:14:31,096
I can't tell you
how excited I am

1117
01:14:31,096 --> 01:14:32,723
for what's about to happen next.

1118
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:37,561
Dad! I'm here to rescue you!

1119
01:14:37,561 --> 01:14:38,645
No, no, no, Junior!

1120
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:40,063
- Get outta here!
- I'm gonna untie you,

1121
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:41,231
and we're gonna
jump off the train!

1122
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:43,025
- No! Just leave me and go!
- I didn't come this far...

1123
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:44,818
just to turn around,
let me untie you!

1124
01:14:44,818 --> 01:14:46,945
You're ruining everything!

1125
01:14:48,113 --> 01:14:49,114
Quick, this way!

1126
01:14:58,832 --> 01:15:00,959
You half-wit! Get them!

1127
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:32,491
The bridge is comin' up!

1128
01:15:32,491 --> 01:15:33,992
We gotta get to the caboose now!

1129
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:35,994
- What? Why?
- Just follow my lead!

1130
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:38,497
Wow!

1131
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:47,422
Oi, kitty cat!

1132
01:15:47,422 --> 01:15:50,509
Did you expect
to take us on all by yourself?

1133
01:15:50,509 --> 01:15:53,887
No. I brought... takeout.

1134
01:16:42,019 --> 01:16:44,146
I never understood
the purpose of salad

1135
01:16:44,146 --> 01:16:46,064
until this exact moment!

1136
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:55,657
Go, go! Now!

1137
01:16:55,657 --> 01:16:56,867
Get after him!

1138
01:17:18,555 --> 01:17:20,057
Yeah, in case
you were wonderin',

1139
01:17:20,057 --> 01:17:21,683
I do my own stunts.

1140
01:17:21,683 --> 01:17:22,768
Me...

1141
01:17:23,894 --> 01:17:25,103
and Tom Cruise.

1142
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:30,484
Junior!

1143
01:17:36,907 --> 01:17:37,908
Stop him!

1144
01:17:58,428 --> 01:17:59,763
Now <i>that's</i> amazing!

1145
01:17:59,763 --> 01:18:01,139
I can't feel my tongue.

1146
01:18:01,139 --> 01:18:02,224
<i>Roadkill!</i>

1147
01:18:02,224 --> 01:18:04,142
<i>Are you at the caboose,
ready to jump?</i>

1148
01:18:26,874 --> 01:18:28,250
Dad! Dad!

1149
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,252
Jump, Junior! I'll catch you!

1150
01:18:55,986 --> 01:18:57,404
What do we do now?

1151
01:18:57,404 --> 01:18:58,655
We do this!

1152
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:03,702
See ya, everyone.

1153
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:11,293
The net's too tight!

1154
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:12,794
Roadkill, the net is too tight!

1155
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:13,879
I heard!

1156
01:19:20,802 --> 01:19:22,888
Hello again, welcome back!

1157
01:19:23,222 --> 01:19:24,806
Now, where were we?

1158
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:35,651
No, no!
Don't throw them over just yet.

1159
01:19:35,651 --> 01:19:36,777
No!

1160
01:19:37,194 --> 01:19:39,154
I want to find the perfect place

1161
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:41,657
for them
to make the biggest splat.

1162
01:19:42,324 --> 01:19:44,618
Hey, hey! Junior!
Junior, Junior.

1163
01:19:44,618 --> 01:19:46,870
Get ready! Almost there!

1164
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:50,123
I'm sorry
my rescue didn't work out.

1165
01:19:50,249 --> 01:19:53,252
No, you gave me another chance.

1166
01:19:53,836 --> 01:19:55,420
That's all that matters.

1167
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:02,219
Now, now! Drop them now!

1168
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:05,472
What are you waiting for?

1169
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:10,435
Their love for one another
indicates that

1170
01:20:10,435 --> 01:20:12,563
despite their
current circumstance,

1171
01:20:12,563 --> 01:20:14,356
they are at peace.

1172
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:17,568
- Because they are together.
- So?

1173
01:20:17,568 --> 01:20:20,153
If the point of your revenge
was to hurt them,

1174
01:20:20,153 --> 01:20:22,447
it has done the opposite.

1175
01:20:22,573 --> 01:20:24,283
It's actually textbook irony!

1176
01:20:24,283 --> 01:20:27,953
And we're no longer
comfortable with your plan.

1177
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,956
You two
are still as weak as you were

1178
01:20:30,956 --> 01:20:33,458
when I found you
sniveling in the pound.

1179
01:20:34,168 --> 01:20:35,711
"No one will adopt us.

1180
01:20:35,711 --> 01:20:37,796
"I never grew into my folds.

1181
01:20:37,796 --> 01:20:40,215
"I hide behind them
because I'm socially awkward.

1182
01:20:40,215 --> 01:20:41,675
"Please, somebody love me

1183
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,677
"even though I can't sit still
for more than ten seconds

1184
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:45,971
and have the attention span
of a bloody goldfish!"

1185
01:20:46,513 --> 01:20:49,433
We did everything
you ever asked of us.

1186
01:20:49,433 --> 01:20:51,602
I even spoke
with this ridiculous accent

1187
01:20:51,602 --> 01:20:53,437
to make you feel more at home.

1188
01:20:53,437 --> 01:20:54,730
But no more!

1189
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:57,024
I'm New York, loud and proud!

1190
01:20:57,024 --> 01:20:59,318
I love myself the way I am

1191
01:20:59,318 --> 01:21:02,196
and I'm a big, brave, boy, baby!

1192
01:21:02,321 --> 01:21:05,490
And I've been
working on my attention span.

1193
01:21:05,616 --> 01:21:06,700
Is that a hot air balloon?

1194
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:08,994
You two...

1195
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:10,704
are...

1196
01:21:10,704 --> 01:21:12,039
Worthless!

1197
01:21:51,662 --> 01:21:55,374
Might I just say as someone else
with a zaftig figure,

1198
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:57,042
you have a beautiful body, sir.

1199
01:21:58,752 --> 01:21:59,795
Oh, dear!

1200
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:06,760
Rope. Versatile. Reliable.

1201
01:22:06,885 --> 01:22:08,345
There's something
about your cadence

1202
01:22:08,345 --> 01:22:09,847
that really throws me,
but thank you.

1203
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:23,110
Tee-hee!

1204
01:22:25,195 --> 01:22:28,198
Tossing me off the train?
Did not see that coming.

1205
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:29,783
Well, when you live in the wild,

1206
01:22:29,783 --> 01:22:31,910
you gotta keep your head
on a swivel.

1207
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:33,495
Right.

1208
01:22:34,204 --> 01:22:37,416
It's basic Outdoor Cat 101.

1209
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:39,501
And that had bird poop on it.

1210
01:22:40,002 --> 01:22:42,004
Hey. You good, Roadkill?

1211
01:22:43,714 --> 01:22:44,798
Not quite.

1212
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:47,634
There's one last thing
to take care of.

1213
01:22:47,885 --> 01:22:48,886
Cut to...

1214
01:22:56,602 --> 01:22:59,354
<i>It was a dark and foggy night.</i>

1215
01:22:59,354 --> 01:23:04,067
<i>The air was damp and
heavier than a broken heart.</i>

1216
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:06,153
<i>On nights like this,
you can't swing a cat</i>

1217
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:08,530
<i>without hittin' shady characters</i>

1218
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:11,658
<i>makin' shady deals
all over town.</i>

1219
01:23:15,037 --> 01:23:17,831
<i>But this night
was going to be... different.</i>

1220
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:20,459
<i>Justice was about to be served.</i>

1221
01:23:20,459 --> 01:23:25,047
<i>With a helping
of retribution on the side.</i>

1222
01:23:25,047 --> 01:23:27,716
Is that... the package?

1223
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:29,718
<i>It is.</i>

1224
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:31,136
Then we have a deal.

1225
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:38,185
<i>No one will come
looking for her?</i>

1226
01:23:38,185 --> 01:23:40,479
Nope. I did what you said.

1227
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:42,189
I burned her paperwork.

1228
01:23:42,189 --> 01:23:44,608
And then shredded it
and burned it some more.

1229
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:47,361
It's like she never existed.

1230
01:23:47,778 --> 01:23:50,739
Except for the image of her face
on millions of dairy products.

1231
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:11,468
This...

1232
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:12,803
<i>never happened.</i>

1233
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:14,304
Agreed.

1234
01:24:17,891 --> 01:24:19,393
Save it, Cat Fancy.

1235
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:21,019
I know you planned
the milk truck heist...

1236
01:24:21,019 --> 01:24:23,063
and then tried to throw those
innocent cats off a train

1237
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:24,147
to cover it up.

1238
01:24:24,147 --> 01:24:26,149
The boys told me everything.

1239
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,709
Otto!

1240
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,758
You are my day.

1241
01:24:52,342 --> 01:24:54,553
You are my night.

1242
01:25:33,467 --> 01:25:35,385
Well, this is us.

1243
01:25:36,053 --> 01:25:38,096
Right. You're home.

1244
01:25:41,099 --> 01:25:43,268
- Hey, listen, I'm sorry.
- I just want to say I'm sorry.

1245
01:25:44,186 --> 01:25:45,771
What are you sorry for?

1246
01:25:49,191 --> 01:25:50,567
For misjudging you.

1247
01:25:52,611 --> 01:25:54,988
Well. Thanks.

1248
01:25:55,697 --> 01:25:57,658
Well, I just wanted to
apologize to you for...

1249
01:25:57,658 --> 01:26:00,994
Everything bad that happened
to us the last three days?

1250
01:26:00,994 --> 01:26:03,163
You know, you had your hand in

1251
01:26:03,163 --> 01:26:05,332
a few bad decisions
back there too, but...

1252
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:09,795
yeah, I'm sorry for
dragging you into my world.

1253
01:26:10,337 --> 01:26:12,381
This is where you belong,

1254
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:14,508
here with Jon and...

1255
01:26:14,508 --> 01:26:16,468
What's your name again? Odor?

1256
01:26:21,348 --> 01:26:24,518
- So... yeah, I should go.
- Yeah, yeah.

1257
01:26:24,643 --> 01:26:26,270
I mean, unless...
you'd want to come in?

1258
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:27,938
Nah. No, no.
I don't think that would work.

1259
01:26:27,938 --> 01:26:30,816
- You know, I'm an outdoor cat.
- Right. Sure. Sure.

1260
01:26:30,941 --> 01:26:33,443
- No, I just... I figured that...
- No, no, no, I get it.

1261
01:26:33,443 --> 01:26:34,653
But, you know what?

1262
01:26:34,653 --> 01:26:38,031
I got this thing on the other
side of town I gotta go do so...

1263
01:26:38,031 --> 01:26:39,867
No. I'm very busy too. Yeah.

1264
01:26:41,618 --> 01:26:42,661
See you around then?

1265
01:26:43,328 --> 01:26:44,371
You know where to find me.

1266
01:26:44,371 --> 01:26:45,622
In the kitchen.

1267
01:26:50,252 --> 01:26:51,545
Well, take care.

1268
01:26:53,172 --> 01:26:56,175
And remember,
"stay out of the pinecone."

1269
01:27:00,637 --> 01:27:03,390
What? You heard him.
It's for the best.

1270
01:27:10,022 --> 01:27:12,441
You're back?
What is going on? Are you okay?

1271
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:13,775
I was so worried!

1272
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:15,402
You know, I was gonna
add more locks to the door,

1273
01:27:15,402 --> 01:27:17,487
you know, try to keep you in,
but then I thought, "Well,

1274
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:19,281
"what if they wanted
to be outdoor pets?"

1275
01:27:19,281 --> 01:27:21,074
Do you wanna be free-range?

1276
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:24,077
I really missed you guys.
And I gotta say...

1277
01:27:24,077 --> 01:27:26,997
it's great to be together again,
the whole entire family.

1278
01:27:26,997 --> 01:27:29,499
You have no idea what the
last few days have been like.

1279
01:27:29,499 --> 01:27:31,752
Phone calls, and hold times
and tears. And more tears.

1280
01:27:31,752 --> 01:27:33,670
Don't give me that,
I asked him to stay.

1281
01:27:34,588 --> 01:27:35,797
He wanted to leave!

1282
01:27:35,797 --> 01:27:37,591
You heard him,
he said he had to...

1283
01:27:37,591 --> 01:27:38,675
Well, I...

1284
01:27:39,843 --> 01:27:41,386
- A family should consist...
- Fine. I'll be right back!

1285
01:27:41,512 --> 01:27:43,472
Wait, wait, what?

1286
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:46,475
Am I using trigger words
that I'm not aware of?

1287
01:28:19,132 --> 01:28:22,970
So, you coming in or do we have
to bring food up there to you?

1288
01:28:27,975 --> 01:28:29,434
I'll come to you.

1289
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,895
I just need to
finish something up here.

1290
01:28:46,994 --> 01:28:50,873
You know, those notches
show how much you love me.

1291
01:28:51,248 --> 01:28:53,208
Is that
what you think they mean?

1292
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:54,376
Yeah.

1293
01:28:54,376 --> 01:28:58,088
Nah, I was just counting how
many slices of lasagna you ate.

1294
01:29:03,385 --> 01:29:05,095
<i>My medium is cuisine...</i>

1295
01:29:05,095 --> 01:29:08,473
<i>my colors are flavors...</i>

1296
01:29:09,433 --> 01:29:12,477
{\an8}<i>...my palette is my palate...
if you will.</i>

1297
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:22,112
Dinner is served!

1298
01:29:27,284 --> 01:29:29,912
Wow, son,
I didn't know you could cook.

1299
01:29:29,912 --> 01:29:32,414
Yes, pasta is my paint, and...

1300
01:29:32,414 --> 01:29:35,375
the dinner plate my... canvas.

1301
01:29:36,627 --> 01:29:37,836
That's where that went.

1302
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:47,804
I've had worse.

1303
01:29:54,311 --> 01:29:55,812
Thank you, Garfield.

1304
01:29:59,942 --> 01:30:02,236
Is he gonna be coming around
for dinner often?

1305
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:04,821
Yeah, he's family.

1306
01:30:09,952 --> 01:30:11,870
What?
Why do I have a takeout bill

1307
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:13,830
for 6,000 drone deliveries?

1308
01:37:22,384 --> 01:37:26,805
<i>This is just what I had planned</i>

1309
01:37:26,805 --> 01:37:29,474
<i>Though I'm thrilled to meet you</i>

1310
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,812
<i>I'm just a minx of English brand</i>

1311
01:37:33,812 --> 01:37:36,398
<i>Dreamed of the cat show</i>

1312
01:37:36,398 --> 01:37:38,108
<i>'Til one night in the street</i>

1313
01:37:38,108 --> 01:37:39,902
<i>'Twas my chance I would meet</i>

1314
01:37:39,902 --> 01:37:41,445
<i>A meow so discreet</i>

1315
01:37:41,445 --> 01:37:44,489
<i>We had the world on a string</i>

1316
01:37:45,032 --> 01:37:49,620
<i>'Til he cut town
and left me empty-handed</i>

1317
01:37:52,706 --> 01:37:54,249
<i>I'm back</i>

1318
01:37:54,249 --> 01:37:56,418
<i>And I'm on the prowl</i>

1319
01:37:56,418 --> 01:37:59,546
<i>Revenge would taste
so sweet right now</i>

1320
01:37:59,546 --> 01:38:01,715
<i>- I'm back
- She's back</i>

1321
01:38:01,715 --> 01:38:03,425
<i>It's time for war</i>

1322
01:38:03,425 --> 01:38:07,262
<i>Watch me scratch, hear me roar</i>

1323
01:38:07,262 --> 01:38:08,972
<i>She's a cat on the prowl</i>

1324
01:38:08,972 --> 01:38:10,724
<i>Got a mighty meow</i>

1325
01:38:10,724 --> 01:38:12,351
<i>She's the queen of the streets</i>

1326
01:38:12,351 --> 01:38:15,020
<i>Her name is Jinx</i>

1327
01:38:15,145 --> 01:38:16,438
<i>That's me</i>

1328
01:38:16,438 --> 01:38:19,358
<i>I'm back</i>

1329
01:38:20,234 --> 01:38:23,529
<i>I can't believe
he double-crossed me</i>

1330
01:38:24,071 --> 01:38:26,949
<i>That really was so mean</i>

1331
01:38:27,533 --> 01:38:29,493
<i>We were friends from the start</i>

1332
01:38:29,493 --> 01:38:31,745
<i>A real work of art</i>

1333
01:38:31,745 --> 01:38:35,999
<i>The thickest of feline thieves</i>

1334
01:38:35,999 --> 01:38:37,668
<i>He came up with a scheme</i>

1335
01:38:37,668 --> 01:38:39,878
<i>To steal all the cream</i>

1336
01:38:39,878 --> 01:38:43,590
<i>But I was the only one caught</i>

1337
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:45,467
<i>I was locked in a cage</i>

1338
01:38:45,467 --> 01:38:47,761
<i>Where my heart filled with rage</i>

1339
01:38:47,886 --> 01:38:50,764
<i>And I developed
this maniacal scream</i>

1340
01:38:54,059 --> 01:38:55,060
Ay, yo.

1341
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:56,603
<i>It's doggy-diggity-
diggity-diggity-D</i>

1342
01:38:56,603 --> 01:38:58,480
<i>I'm bringing the
biggity-biggity-biggity-beats</i>

1343
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,816
<i>- Don't you...</i>
- No, no, no. Shush.

1344
01:39:00,816 --> 01:39:02,317
In case you hadn't noticed...

1345
01:39:02,317 --> 01:39:05,988
<i>I'm back and I'm on the prowl</i>

1346
01:39:05,988 --> 01:39:09,074
<i>Revenge would taste
so sweet right now</i>

1347
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:10,784
<i>- Well, I'm back
- She's back</i>

1348
01:39:10,909 --> 01:39:13,036
<i>And it's time for war</i>

1349
01:39:13,036 --> 01:39:16,915
<i>Watch me scratch, hear me roar</i>

1350
01:39:16,915 --> 01:39:18,625

<i>She's the queen of the streets</i>

01:39:26,508 --> 01:39:28,927
<i>- I'm back
- She's back, she's back</i>

1356

<i>She's back, she's back</i>

1358
01:39:32,222 --> 01:39:34,057
<i>A mighty meow</i>

1359
01:39:34,057 --> 01:39:35,142
<i>She's back</i>

<i>That's me</i>

01:39:40,022 --> 01:39:43,859
<i>I'm back</i>

1363
01:39:43,859 --> 01:39:46,069
<i>She's biggity, biggity,
biggity, bigitty back</i>

1364
01:39:46,069 --> 01:39:47,613
<i>I'm back</i>
