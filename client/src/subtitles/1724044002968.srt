00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,958
Sweetie! Where are you?

4
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,292
Sweetie! Where are you?

5
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,375
Sweetie! Where are you?
Sweetie! Where are you?

6
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:50,958
Sweetie! Where are you?

7
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,625
Sweetie! Where are you?

8
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:56,125
Sweetie! Where are you?
Sweetie! Where are you? Darling ...

9
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:07,167
Voicemail again? This is my 10th message!

10
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,875
Where are you hell are you? I'm with my parents. Waiting for you.

11
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:14,333
And it's  my birthday! I hope you have a good excuse.

12
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:23,167
Damn!

13
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,292
Damn!

14
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:31,792
Dammit!

15
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,083
Dammit!

16
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,110
-Hallo?
-Pierre?  Paul Edward here.

17
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,292
I'm screwed.

18
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,958
-Did you screw her?
-Yes. You must help me.

19
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:42,458
Damn!

20
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:43,708
What should I do ???

21
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,083
-I may have a solution.
-Go ahead, I'm listening!

22
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,540
But  I want a compensation.
-Are you serious?

23
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:58,375
Steven?

24
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:00,417
Yes?

25
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,110
Please when you are about to leave,

26
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,792
be careful that you don't wake the children.
- Yeah ... yeah, yeah.

27
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,292
Did you get it? How do I solve it?

28
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:12,333
I'll give you a number to a business that will save you.

29
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,333
What business?

30
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:15,583
I'll kill him!

31
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,792
I swear on my mother's life!
Sorry, Mom.

32
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:28,940
-Miss, your fiance is a hero.
-What happened?

33
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:32,150
He sacrificed himself to save Timmy,
a blind boy's dog.

34
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:34,790
It ended with a night in the hospital and a broken phone.

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,240
You can be proud of him.

36
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,833
And I yelled at him.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,375
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:41,333
I'm a monster!

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,542
Forgive me.

40
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,833
I'm sorry, darling. How are you?

41
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,583
And see.

42
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,500
Now he can enjoy his day without worrying.

43
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,292
And thanks to us.

44
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,875
Bravo. Brilliant.

45
00:02:56,042 --> 00:03:00,400
Your appearance and success with women
inspired you to create  this business?

46
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:02,360
That's nice, but no. When I was 10 years old

47
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:06,280
my mother caught my father. He never fully recovered.

48
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:08,292
My father was sorry and I suffered.

49
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,500
If she didn't catch them, none of this would have happened.

50
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,740
Your CV looks great. Impressive.

51
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,125
Only one question.

52
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:19,530
-Why don't you stay anywhere for more than 6 months?
-Routine makes me bored.

53
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:22,292
I'll never be bored in your business.

54
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,292
Pardon.

55
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,417
Yes?

56
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,740
He will be always late for work.

57
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,917
Why?

58
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:34,450
Imagine how much time he takes just to gel his hair.

59
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,620
Then you will have to start earlier.

60
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,042
Anyway,

61
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,458
Your profile is interesting. If you want, you're welcome here.

62
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,792
If you have any questions, don't hesitate, ask.

63
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:48,708
Just one.

64
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:52,792
When does the training start, boss?

65
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:58,083
A small lie causes smaller damage than
the whole truth.

66
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,940
Live your life as you wish
and be discreet.

67
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,208
This is our motto.

68
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,280
-Francoise! How are you doing?
-Excellent.

69
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:08,792
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

70
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,990
See you next week.

71
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,550
-Francoise, beware.
-Your blouse is the other way around.

72
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:17,167
Thank you.

73
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:23,990
-Who would like some pastries?              -I do.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,900
Great idea with the cooking class.

75
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:29,990
But now you have a stain on your skirt.
Piglet!

76
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:33,833
Some say that our company is immoral.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,570
Wrong. I don't think it's good, but of people are doing it.

78
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,000
We just do not want them to suffer, Protect them.

79
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,110
Adultery is not the main thing among our clients.

80
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:46,000
These are the typical colors for Pont-l'Abbe,
yellow and orange.

81
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:47,750
This is Romain!

82
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,333
Yeah, darling.
-Peek a boo, baby!

83
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,490
-Good evening, Jacques Martin.
-Good evening, Romain!

84
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,125
-Still at the office?
Yeah, don't even start.

85
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:58,000
Our boss moved the meeting for next morning.

86
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,440
Start  without me,  I might join you for a dessert.

87
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,125
Can't you free yourself up?

88
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:05,740
Otherwise you'll miss the photos of Pont-l'Abbe,
from the Museum of the Bigouden culture.

89
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,292
Oh no! What a pity!

90
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,417
I have to go. I have a work to do.

91
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,250
Hugs to all of you.

92
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:12,625
-Bye, dear!
-Bye, Romain!

93
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,542
Great, it was good. Super! Super!

94
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:19,917
-Should I leave it here?    -Yes.

95
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,780
How long will  you stay with your mother? Until Sunday.

96
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:32,458
You know how she would like to see you.

97
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,690
The whole weekend in the mountains with you
and your mother. No, thank you.

98
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,042
As you wish.

99
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,570
-Hello, Mr. Godet. Is everything alright?
-It could not be better.

100
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:49,530
Excited like a fly on cow's ass.

101
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,990
-Good day, Mr. Godet.
-Good day. How are you ?

102
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,417
-Bon voyage, Mr. Godet.
-Thank you.

103
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,667
So, Vegas ?

104
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,320
Better than bingo at the local church.

105
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,958
Your toll tickets all the way to Albertville.

106
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,708
-Here is some local cheese and salami.
-Thank you.

107
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:20,280
-Why does he keep winning lottery secret from this wife?
-Because his divorce isn't final yet.

108
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,417
Hello.

109
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,750
-Allow me to introduce Clara.
-Hello.

110
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,167
Is it good?

111
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,458
Yes, good.

112
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,833
Continue, continue.

113
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,400
-Are you here, baby?
-Yes, I am here.

114
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:07,150
-Did the promo turn out well, darling?
-I am so done.

115
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,990
I'm making  salmon with vegetable garnish.

116
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,990
Yes? I would prefer you as a garnish,

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,070
and then we'll watch Frozen.

118
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:21,440
We create bulletproof alibi  for our clients
in order to protect their little secrets

119
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,667
from their family and close ones
and protect  them from stress.

120
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,292
Our custom made solutions protect

121
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:30,667
our clients without any prejudice from us.

122
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,550
Our goal is to help people.

123
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,110
Here it is the contract. Here - a signature.

124
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,875
This is a confidentiality agreement.

125
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:45,875
What are you doing later?

126
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:49,458
-Can we go out for a drink?
-I am sorry. I am engaged.

127
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,292
I was not talking to you.

128
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,500
I told you it's over.

129
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,660
You knew that a serious relationship is nothing for me.

130
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:03,660
All right. How about a little music?

131
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,792
Again Greg's playlist. I'm so sick of the 80s.

132
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,583
You don't know anything.
It was the best decade.

133
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,770
-It's delicious.        -Thank you.

134
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,208
Greg, can you stop?
-Why?

135
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,958
I need to talk to you.

136
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,333
What's going on?

137
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,958
What's your game with Mehdi?

138
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:46,910
Don't start again. Have I ever betrayed you
during our 20 years of friendship?

139
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:50,375
Stop being jealous. We are, after all, a team of superheroes.

140
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,542
You're Batman, I'm Superman.

141
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,330
I know, but the Muslim has never been a member of our team.

142
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,417
Stop with that.

143
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,708
Come on.

144
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,958
Well, come on.

145
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,208
See? Everything okay?

146
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,375
-Any more questions?
-No. Yes.

147
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,900
Why did you not stay with Clara? It's a lovely girl.

148
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,208
I'm not in love with her.

149
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,990
You say that everytime,
because you're traumatized by your parents.

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,250
It prevents you from falling in love.

151
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:16,458
Does not, I just cannot.

152
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,880
You have something to talk about,
you are still a virgin.

153
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,650
The only vagina you saw was your mother's.

154
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:23,708
I am saving my flower for the soulmate of my heart.

155
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,650
-That's something else.
-You did not dare.

156
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:26,667
Yes.

157
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,750
Life  is not just  video games and superheroes ...

158
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,792
Guys, are you serious?

159
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,500
These are the things that makes me disgusted.
Such as this. Gross!

160
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,667
Come on, mate. Go.

161
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,667
Lookie!

162
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:00,917
Lookie...

163
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,333
Lookie!

164
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,083
Oh no!

165
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,667
I should have tie him better. It's a playful puppy.

166
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,360
It's unnecessary to fell guilty. It was not your fault.

167
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,708
I should  have taken him along when I needed to pee.

168
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,330
But when someone is looking at me, I can't pee.

169
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,417
Well?

170
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,417
Well what? He croaked, your pooch!

171
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,833
And that's good!

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,500
I cannot stand those beasts.

173
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,333
It was a joke. I am joking.

174
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,250
The pooch is fine!

175
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:40,667
A bump and a brokentooth.
He can go to Roland-Garros (French Open) tomorrow.

176
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:44,417
Damn, this is good! Would you like some?
It'll kick your ass.

177
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,875
-And you,  blondie?
-No, thanks.

178
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:48,708
No fun with the two of you.

179
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,708
Come tomorrow and pick up your mutt. Bye.

180
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,917
Okay ... great!
What a relief.

181
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,292
I do not know how to thank you ??.

182
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,950
Meal? Money? BJ?

183
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:08,800
Excuse me. When I'm stressed, I say vulgarities.

184
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:09,990
It is nothing.

185
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,790
In addition, I'm not hungry.

186
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,458
Alright?

187
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,542
Yes Yes.

188
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:24,542
Okay ...     -I have to go now.

189
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,833
-All right.
-Thank you for accompanying me.

190
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,240
-I am Florence, Florence Martin.
-Gregory. Gregory Van Huffel.

191
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,000
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

192
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,542
Well, we dropped off Clare.

193
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,250
Are you okay?

194
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,125
I'm not sure.

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
-ADD. Invitations sent

196
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:15,100
-Hello.        -Hello.

197
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,780
I came on behalf of my married friend.

198
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:23,070
He met a young lady and he would like to spend

199
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,570
a weekend with her..

200
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,150
He would like to know whether you can help?
-I understand.

201
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:28,458
What is your friend's name?

202
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,875
His name?

203
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,250
-Jean Claude.
-Jean Claude. Good.

204
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,542
Tell your friend we can easily manage,

205
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,070
that we will provide an alibi with a double.

206
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,990
We will send someone to pretend to be him in his place.

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,690
His double will use his credit card
and show up where he needs to be.

208
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:48,990
At the same time we will give another cad to Jean-Claude
with which he can pay anything,

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,940
without it turning up on his bank statement.
-I understand.

210
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,542
Where would like to go ???

211
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,150
-Here.
-The Cannes. All right.

212
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,280
Savings of 70%. Your friend likes to save, eh?

213
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:03,083
I do not know. Well then?

214
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,917
-All right. I will give you a form for Jean-Claude.

215
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,110
so that we can come up with the best alibi.

216
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,667
See you, Jean-Claude.

217
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:17,700
See you ... yes.

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Lookie is much better. He would invite you for dinner to reward you.

219
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,417
That was for you, Lookie.

220
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:43,110
-An unusual place for dinner.
-You thought it was a date?

221
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,542
Not at all. Facebook says that you are taken.

222
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,900
Cute, he spied on me.  No, that status is strategic.

223
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:53,070
Otherwise I would get a lot of requests for friendship.

224
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,650
Don't get fooled. I was not hitting on you.

225
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,440
I wanted to know about Lookie, simply as a friend.

226
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,083
Be so kind and take him for a minute.

227
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:11,900
So what else do you do other than bowling
and peeing in the woods?

228
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,860
-I'm a lawyer.
-Lawyer? And that means?

229
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:19,500
I work with law. I hate cheaters and liars.

230
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,250
-And what do you do?
-Me?

231
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:23,610
I...

232
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,690
I..

233
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,500
I am a flight attendant.

234
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,000
Great!

235
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:32,708
Sorry.

236
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,070
Seriously? Jean Luc Lahaye as a ringing tone?

237
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,440
Don't tease me, I like him. So what?

238
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,550
Your turn, stewardess.

239
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:51,070
-Stewardess! You are going to get it!
-You? Do you want to bet on it?

240
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,330
-I bet on whatever you want.
-All right.

241
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:04,125
-Break. Down.
-Stop, it is not fair.

242
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:07,660
Turn around, because the bet. Come on.

243
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,583
Coward!

244
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,875
No one will call me coward!

245
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,375
Strike!

246
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:23,333
Yes...

247
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,708
It is not possible!

248
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,110
Let's see. I won.

249
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,070
Apparently, he's better, right? It's fine.

250
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,917
Yeah, better ?? s. -We are going?

251
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:10,083
All right? Are you satisfied?

252
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,917
-Totally!
-My dress ??!

253
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,360
-I have not had this much fun in ages. Cool.

254
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:18,860
You make fun of my ringtone and yet you watch movies with Van Damme!

255
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:22,820
Bloodsport is the best movie ever.
And my  biggest frustration.

256
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,150
I could never manage his kick while turning.

257
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:26,208
Great life!

258
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:30,440
Do not be disrespectful. No my fault you are not good in bowling.

259
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,090
I hope there some things you are better in, because
this time you let me down.

260
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,292
All right. Get up!

261
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,750
-What?          -Up!

262
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,875
Who laughs as first, gets a slap.

263
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:43,667
Good.

264
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,708
No, you can't ...

265
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:13,208
You lost.

266
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,667
Will you take me home?

267
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Easy on the gas ... Greg

268
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:09,500
-Now!
-I  so want to see it!

269
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,070
Excuse me.
Flo didn't tell me the cleaning woman comes today.

270
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,250
I'm her mother.

271
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,292
I understand.

272
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,330
From Flo. She'll be here in half an hour.

273
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,208
Great.

274
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,990
Sorry. It is not...

275
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,625
Yes. No, I more so than you.

276
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,042
Oh, stop.

277
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,000
-Me too. A kiss.
-Hello!

278
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,820
Charlie? What are you doing here?

279
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,570
I told you I'm not a babysitter.

280
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,240
I do not want to go school, they all tease me.

281
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,900
In one month, you had the flu, appendix,

282
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:09,125
lost both grandmothers, what more do you want?

283
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:14,000
Let's say I have menopause. Mother doesn't work since her menopause.

284
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,990
Come back in an hour, we will give you something.

285
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Well, go. But this is the last time.

286
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,860
All is well. The car is shiny.

287
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,542
Thanks, Mehdi, but it was not necessary.

288
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:29,550
Are you joking? You cannot see your in-laws with a dirty car.

289
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,740
-Are you going to in-laws?
-Yes.

290
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,360
-Nice that I learned it.
-You did not know?

291
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,650
I'm sorry, Augustin. I was so stressed, I forgot about it.

292
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,375
It will be alright, mate.

293
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:43,990
There is nothing that can happen, nothing worse than what already
happened with her mother.

294
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,490
Hey Dad! I introduce to you

295
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,690
Greg, famous cop - steward.
Greg, my father.

296
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,000
-Hello, Jean-Claude.
-Gerard.

297
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:57,917
Gerard, forgive me.

298
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,250
Come inside.

299
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:08,500
Gerard, did you touch my picture?
It's always lopsided.

300
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,958
-Darling!
-Hi, Mom!

301
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,490
-Good afternoon, Marlene.
-Good afternoon, Greg.

302
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,917
Today you are dressed.

303
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,190
That's good otherwise your father might feel inferior.

304
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,190
-Why did you set the table for five?
-I invited Maurice.

305
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,542
Oh, the entertainment will be taken care of.

306
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,740
Poor guy. He got separated recently.

307
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,292
She cheated. Everyone knew except for him.

308
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,292
Horrible.

309
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,190
-Really.
-Now everyone thinks of him as an ass.

310
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:37,250
He became a wreck. Unpleasant. Wreck!

311
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,220
I am here.

312
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,110
I'm sorry, Maurice. I did not hear you come in.

313
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:45,458
It's OK. I brought a small a gift.

314
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,940
It will go nicely in the living room.

315
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:49,958
You should not have.

316
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:55,100
It's you Marlene. I spent on it more than 352 hours.

317
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:57,542
-More then Gerard.
-Now ...

318
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,440
I'll bring the wine. You coming with me, Greg?

319
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:03,690
-I brought some wine.
-A real wine.

320
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,990
-I can go.
- No, that's good.

321
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:10,167
Come.

322
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,292
Flight attendant! How dare you lie to my daughter?

323
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,458
Is that a joke?
And you? Jean-Claude?

324
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,150
Let's settle it.
It's not fair to Flo.

325
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:21,375
-No settling of anything!
-Sorry.

326
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,417
-I'll cancel the contract then.
-Under no circumstances!

327
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,990
I said no, Gerard!

328
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,458
Fine.

329
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,083
No worries.

330
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,490
Thank you. It's better, healthier.

331
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,690
-Yes. We will be honest and say  to Flo what your job is.

332
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,860
-Not! Please.
- But it's healthier.

333
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,280
I just do not know whether she will manage to forgive you.

334
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:46,990
Her last boyfriend  got dumped,  when he cheated  at Monopoly.

335
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,400
-So I have no choice?
-I don't think not.

336
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:57,190
-Did you blackmail her other men?
- No, you are the first who was introduced to us.

337
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,530
-Where was it?
-New Delhi, in 87

338
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:06,167
For "Doctors Without Borders".

339
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,333
-Such memories!
-Lovely.

340
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,583
Truly brilliant.

341
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:14,780
-Is that you, Maurice?
-Yes.

342
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:17,990
With my son and wife before she cheated on me.

343
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:20,250
-Your son?
-Yes.

344
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:24,333
There was a million to one that we would have a black baby.

345
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:26,542
And we were lucky.

346
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,990
There were some who win the lottery, we had a black baby.

347
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,250
-And who is this?
-The mayor of the village.

348
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:38,990
Very nice. We were there every  year.

349
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:44,220
That year we met with Gerard.
We danced  a lot.

350
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,820
At that time, we were like Jay-Z and Beyonce.

351
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,667
Those years are  long gone.

352
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:54,000
On Saturday, we have our 30th  wedding anniversary..
Gerard is not going to be at home.

353
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,042
Really?

354
00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:00,250
Pharmaceutical seminar in Beauvais,
poor soul.

355
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,875
Oh well, responsibilities...

356
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:08,500
It's okay, mum. I will be with you.
Greg is going  to Tanzania tomorrow.

357
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,250
Let's see our lovers.

358
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,880
If you wish, I will come and encourage you.

359
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:18,208
No, no need, Maurice. It will be a ladies' weekend.

360
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,990
I too want to show you a few photos.

361
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,708
-Do you want to live together ???
-Yes!

362
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,125
We found a great flat.
I hope we reach an agreement.

363
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:30,167
I  am very happy.

364
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,320
You didn't say that I am the first man whom
you introduced to your parents.

365
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,550
I did not want to scare you.

366
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,940
I'm sad that my mum is so depressed.

367
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:58,990
She is so bored since she retired.
And she will be all alone on her  wedding anniversary. Poor mum.

368
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:03,200
-Try to entertain her.
Yeah, you are right.

369
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:07,330
Have I told you already that I love you?

370
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,660
-No.
-How silly of me.

371
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,660
I do not want to be alone through the weekend.

372
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:19,290
Welcome to the seminar, Mr. Martin. Enjoy your stay in Beauvais.

373
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,330
Sweetie, this message will reach you when you land in Tanzania.

374
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,990
I hope you had a good flight. I miss you.

375
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:44,833
This is it ...

376
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:46,417
This is it.

377
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:50,500
It is far from it.

378
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:55,667
Yes, Gerard?

379
00:25:55,833 --> 00:26:00,570
What's with the credit card?
I ordered  something to eat, a couple of bottles, now it does not work.

380
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:01,375
Darling!

381
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:02,792
Are you sure?

382
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,833
MARLENE - waiting call

383
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:12,330
MARLENE - waiting call
Hello? Hello?

384
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:13,620
MARLENE - waiting call
you there?

385
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,570
Hello? Hello, Gerard?
-Yes.

386
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:19,360
There is usually enough money in the account.
How much is a bottle?

387
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,500
Excuse me. How much is a bottle of champagne?

388
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:27,320
-1000 Euros, Sir.
-What? Did I hear correctly? He said 1000 Euros?

389
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:30,900
I am willing to add to the account, but control yourself.

390
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:32,917
You can rely on me.
You can rely on me.

391
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:38,833
- Champagne! For whom?
-For Kiki!

392
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:47,833
No...

393
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,583
No...

394
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:04,500
-I still do not have any like of the video.
-Really?

395
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,530
Very effective. A bit strange.
It's great!

396
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:25,580
-But there are more views than yesterday.
-Maybe because we are looking at it now.

397
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:30,570
I feel like quitting. I'll never get through.

398
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:34,440
What are you saying? Do you know what age was Funes,
when he became famous?

399
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,990
I do not know the singers of your era.
(*Funes is a famous actor, not singer)

400
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:38,833
Come on!

401
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,750
Let's have more champagne.

402
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:45,990
-We had enough for today.
-But not for drinking.

403
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:49,000
At least I'll be in a good for the first time.

404
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,708
Hello? Room service?

405
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:08,875
We would like Dom Perignon in our room.

406
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:14,150
What? How is that you do not have any?
At those hotel prices? Scandalous!

407
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:16,900
They have none. I think I'm dreaming!

408
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:21,320
Do not worry, I'll go and buy some in town.
-Thank you, my darling.

409
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,990
I'll change into something much more casual.

410
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:13,550
-Flo! Ae you going to open?
-I'm coming, Mom. I'm in the bathroom.

411
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,580
I just talked to Maurice. He just fed Lookie.

412
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,400
I hope the dog doesn't become depressed also.

413
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:30,490
The receptionist recommended Beach Zelos for tomorrow.
It is quite nice there.

414
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,530
I did not dare wear my swimsuit, I gained weight.

415
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:36,780
Relax. If you were like father, I'll understand.

416
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:41,000
-Did you talk to him on the phone?
-Could not reach him. I'll try again.

417
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:52,190
Surprise!

418
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:57,360
-What are you doing here?
-We have a wedding anniversary, right?

419
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:01,110
-And your seminar?
-One should have  priorities right in life.

420
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:03,042
-How did you know where we are?

421
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:11,400
-I left a message on his answering machine.
So ... I see, a message.

422
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:16,400
Your outfit is part of the surprise?
That shirt is really very pink!

423
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:19,940
You found a very nice hotel.
How did you find it?

424
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:24,240
Thanks to you, you left the hotel page open on your
computer with a super discount too.

425
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,820
-I wanted to make mum happy.
-It's good you did.

426
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:27,875
Where is your suitcase?

427
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,990
Oh, don't start on it! They lost it at the airport.

428
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,875
-What a pity.
-Yes.

429
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,990
-Really bad luck.
-Yeah ... bad luck.

430
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,000
That is Greg!

431
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:45,030
My love, how are you?

432
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:48,530
All right. Finally we arrived. How are you, honey?

433
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:51,740
Great. I took a trip this weekend with mum.

434
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,740
Great! This will make her feel good.

435
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,990
And look who's here, who came to see us.

436
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,250
Hey!

437
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,542
Hey!

438
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:07,490
Hello, my little Greg? How is Tanzania?

439
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,610
Thank you, good. It's  fantastic, in Tanzania.

440
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:13,150
There are a lot of....zebras.

441
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:16,330
-Will you send me a photo?
-Yes, of course.

442
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:20,440
-Now just you and it would be perfect.
-I would also like to be right there with you.

443
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,570
I am looking forward to seeing you on Monday.

444
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:25,360
-Me too.
-I am already dead tired and we have a poor signal.

445
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:28,650
We'll talk tomorrow? I'll let you be with your parents.

446
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:32,360
I was about to show you my breasts.
Bad luck. Good night. Sweet Dreams.

447
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,990
Bye, my love.

448
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,167
What is this mess?

449
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,990
I don't know. They are in the same hotel as me.

450
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,650
I probably left the page  open on the computer.

451
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,860
- Where is Cynthia?
-In her room. What should I do ???

452
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:49,440
Flo asks tough questions.
I have no suitcase, no wedding ring.

453
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:52,110
And where is the ring?
-At home,  under my briefs.

454
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,280
We will bring you everything.

455
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:54,333
Gerard.

456
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,660
She is coming! I have to hang up.

457
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:12,400
-Hello?
-Cynthia Belinni?

458
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:14,650
-Yes.
-Hello.  This is  police.

459
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:18,320
Please note that Mr Gerard Martin was jailed

460
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:21,708
for public drunkenness and assault on public figure.

461
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:24,125
I'm not surprised, he was drinking all day.

462
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:28,240
I'll note that. We will leave him here.
When we release him, he will call you.

463
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,030
-Can I visit him?
-No ma'am. This is police, not a hospital.

464
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:34,042
OK, fine. A kiss.

465
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:45,490
-So? How does it look?
-We've got a little problem.

466
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,690
The alarm is turned off, but there is a hallway camera.

467
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:54,000
-So we have to turn off  electricity.
-I was ready for this eventuality.

468
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:55,440
I'm going for it.

469
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:58,070
-Not You will stay here.
I will take care of it.

470
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:00,220
You are still in training.

471
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,990
Well, I'm here.

472
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:12,990
I cut the wire.

473
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:21,370
Mission accomplished. Greg, I cut the lines.

474
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:33,000
Well, I will arrange this.
You'll stay here, Greg.

475
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:36,330
I'll smash a window. I don't want to hurt you.

476
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,080
-Alright?
-Yes.

477
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:47,990
-Try one more time?
-Later.

478
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The keys are in the flowerpot.

479
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:04,780
You pack his suitcase.
I will take care of the ring ...

480
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,667
All right. We are going.

481
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,990
-Is this  police?
-I do not know.

482
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,667
Hide!

483
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,917
Lookie?

484
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:43,990
That's Maurice. He came to feed the dog.

485
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,660
Here you are. Your food.

486
00:34:56,917 --> 00:34:58,833
Come on. Let's  hide.

487
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:03,417
Now what?

488
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:06,990
It's been a long time since the two of us were alone.

489
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,660
Did you miss me?

490
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,330
I also missed you.

491
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:19,440
I love it when you are looking at me like this.

492
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,990
We feel so well together!

493
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,583
Yes, good.

494
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,990
Yes, my darling.

495
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,440
You are so beautiful!

496
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,990
Nice that we meet again.

497
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:38,820
You're little naughty girl! Yes.

498
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,660
Have you seen my beast?

499
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:26,958
Damn!

500
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:07,240
-Augustin, did you take care of
that jeweler?        -Yes.

501
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,940
-But it was close.
-All right.

502
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:11,530
Will it go well with the clothes, hotels and business cards?

503
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:12,500
Yes, done.

504
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:15,990
All that remains is the bloody photo  of zebras for Flo.

505
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,990
-I do not know how to do it.
- Oh, damn!

506
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:21,360
-What is it?
-Nothing. Something I forgot.

507
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:23,375
-What did you forget?
-Nothing. Nothing.

508
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:24,417
Say it.

509
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:29,070
All right. I have a small problem with narcolepsy.

510
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,530
-And I take medication.
-Really?

511
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:33,690
Supposed Mr. Perfect!

512
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:36,650
No problem. At the nearest rest stop, you get some coffee.

513
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:38,860
-Will you be okay?
-No problem.

514
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:40,792
Since when do you suffer from it?

515
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:43,940
Mehdi!

516
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:50,042
-Mehdi! Mehdi! Wake up!
-Mehdi! Mehdi!

517
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,250
Mehdi! Mehdi!

518
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,280
It is insane!

519
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:58,570
-Why did  you  not say anything?
-I wanted to have the job.

520
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:02,550
That is why I never lasted anywhere and
I do not want live with my mom anymore.

521
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:07,990
So we have to buy some pills in the pharmacy.
-That will not work, they are  prescription only.

522
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,830
-Let's stop at the nearest parking.
- I think so too.

523
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,440
Why didn't you stop here?

524
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:17,833
Mehdi!

525
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:24,000
Mehdi! Mehdi! Mehdi!

526
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:26,333
Pardon.

527
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,833
You are scaring us!

528
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,708
Bloody hell!

529
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,150
Mehdi! Mehdi!

530
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:35,650
Stop. He is not asleep.

531
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:38,360
-I am up.
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

532
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,958
-Augustin, you drive.
-That's what I am talking about.

533
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,990
What are you doing?

534
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,000
We will take your photo, Greg.

535
00:38:55,958 --> 00:39:00,167
Careful. We are going!
Slowly.

536
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:03,708
Slowly ...

537
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,667
Wait! I'll take a selfie.

538
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:13,660
I do not see it well,  push it.

539
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:18,417
Come ...

540
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,417
Come along, little zebra.

541
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:21,833
Come.

542
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:32,820
-Stop. She kicked me directly in the family jewels.
-Well, you don't use them anyway.

543
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,940
-She broke my face!
-Serves you right!

544
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:37,500
-Mehdi, alright?
-Do not worry, it's nothing.

545
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,958
-Augustin?
-Yes. Yes...

546
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:41,708
Well, we will try again.

547
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:44,167
No...

548
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:46,860
I  still don't have a photo.

549
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,167
-Come, let's try and find it.
-Oh, damn!

550
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,900
Surrounded by wild beasts and afraid of a cat.

551
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:03,330
I have always hated them, leave it.

552
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,940
It's over. She fled.

553
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:11,375
Come on, we're going further.

554
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:15,550
-Augustin, wait!

555
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:18,880
Do we still have some colour in the van?

556
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:08,990
-Hello, sir. Which floor?
- The sixth.

557
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,750
Have a nice day, Sir.

558
00:41:58,417 --> 00:42:01,550
-What are you doing here?
-It's the same thing I could be asking you.

559
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:06,330
Honey, promise me that you don't say
anything to your mother.

560
00:42:07,917 --> 00:42:11,280
-Mrs.Martin?
- No, this is my daughter.

561
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:15,530
Look, do you think you mother will like it?
I was not sure.

562
00:42:15,542 --> 00:42:19,820
Are you joking? It's beautiful.
It must have cost a fortune.

563
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:23,330
Really? But why are you following me?

564
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:28,000
I thought you are going down for breakfast.

565
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:30,990
Shall we meet downstairs?

566
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:43,940
-Now she should leave you alone.
-I hope so. Otherwise she'll never forgive me.

567
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:48,660
-It is really that expensive? What's the price?
-The price of your guilty conscience.

568
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:50,740
Here's your  wedding ring.

569
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,780
I put a label XL Airways on the suitcase. The aim is,

570
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:55,570
to get you far away from the hotel.

571
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:59,070
Therefore, today's agenda is  the vineyards tour.

572
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:01,000
And Cynthia, what will  you do with her?

573
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,167
No worries.

574
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,330
Cynthia?

575
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:16,500
Yes?

576
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:18,070
-Michael. Nice to meet you.

577
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:20,610
-That's Adel, my colleague.
-Nice to meet you.

578
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:23,000
What luck that  we meet here!

579
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,980
I was lucky to discovered your
video  "I hate those sluts".

580
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,440
-Did you like it?
-Absolutely!

581
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:32,030
You had to work on that for years.
How did you get that idea?

582
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:35,750
I hate those silicone women,
who get involved with geezers

583
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:37,280
for champagne.
-I understand.

584
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:39,083
How long have  you worked as  a producer?

585
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:42,780
For 10 years at Universal Music.
Then I opened my own business.

586
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:47,860
I discovered a lot of artists like Lou, Paisley, La Fouine ...

587
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,400
-Amazing, La Fouine!
-I know, thank you.

588
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:51,583
No, because they are here!

589
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:57,375
It's a great!

590
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,500
Funny, yes ...

591
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:01,625
Why not say hello?

592
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:05,542
Well yes...

593
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:09,042
So there, I am going...

594
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:10,500
Let's go.

595
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:17,570
Hi!

596
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:21,110
How are you? Nice to see you.

597
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,150
It's been a long time. How are you?

598
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,240
-Everything cool?
-Who are you?

599
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,030
Don't you recognize me? I was at your gig.

600
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:30,440
Right up front, in the center. That was me.

601
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:33,400
He is joking. What does he want?

602
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,917
Actually, I am looking for toilets.

603
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:39,042
He needs GPS to find a toilet.

604
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,770
It is funny!

605
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:48,600
What? Touching my shoulders?

606
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:49,917
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

607
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:52,990
How can I make up for it? Excuse me.

608
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:56,880
Here.

609
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,250
Oh, that much!

610
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:05,500
Well ... Drinks are on me, guys.

611
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:08,400
I knew you were cool.

612
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:11,190
-I'm cool. Thanks.
-Cool guy.

613
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,320
Thank you, guys.

614
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:13,750
Thanks, thank you.

615
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,000
-Now off you go, idiot!
-Sure.

616
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,610
The guy is a sweetheart! A little intrusive, but nice.

617
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:27,400
-A hat?
-No. Thank you.

618
00:45:27,417 --> 00:45:28,320
What do you want to drink?

619
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:30,740
- Champagne.
-Champagne. Okay.

620
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,083
What do you want?

621
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,770
Red Bull. He will  have Red Bull.

622
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,220
I am with Gerard and Marlene on the way to the vineyards.
Flo is not with us.

623
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:49,333
Taste, but then spit it out.

624
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:55,320
-Where is she?
-- I do not know, but not here.

625
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:58,940
Starting with wine in the lower price level with a uniform taste,

626
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:01,292
but with predominant fruity tones.

627
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,042
Does anyone know which fruit dominates?

628
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,208
Passion fruit!

629
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:09,940
Allegedly Louis XIII had it brought for a feast,

630
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:15,000
because this delicate flavor suited lamb ...

631
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:36,500
All right. As I  told in 1930  Sebastien Hamel completely replanted ...

632
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:39,490
-So boring!
-Shut up! Stop, Marlene.

633
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,333
I drank too much, I need fresh air.

634
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,417
No. Stay here.

635
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:52,400
Come on, let's get out. He is more boring than Maurice.

636
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:54,708
Marlene! Marlene, come back!

637
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,490
What are you doing?
We cannot  abandon the guide!

638
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,375
Oh no! That's exactly what we are going to do.

639
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:09,190
Come on! We  will have fun.

640
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:10,542
You are not serious.

641
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:13,958
Marlene, no!

642
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:22,792
-Stop!
-This thing is great!

643
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:59,320
Slow down! You are crazy!

644
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:02,458
-I can't, my shoe got stuck!
-What?

645
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,110
All right, kiddie?

646
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,458
Beautiful castle!

647
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:47,080
Hurry up. Come on. We are going.

648
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:51,500
Special News Report.

649
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:56,540
South of Africa suffered an earthquake again,
which hit especially Tanzania.

650
00:48:56,542 --> 00:49:00,240
-The French Red Cross ...
-Can you turn the volume up?

651
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:05,110
For now, there are about 700 people missing.
Probably foreigners among them.

652
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:09,200
My name is Cynthia, abbreviated Kiki.
I can't call myself Cycy.

653
00:49:12,292 --> 00:49:16,500
Kiki, live your dream and don't let it go!

654
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:18,650
Answer me DAMMIT

655
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:19,708
Come on, Kiki!

656
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,600
Such is Kiki. She takes it all or nothing!

657
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,530
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

658
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:28,708
It's the studio. I'll leave for a minute.

659
00:49:31,292 --> 00:49:32,458
A real Kiki!

660
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:34,167
Cheers!

661
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:35,250
In Tanzania?

662
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:40,990
-Yeah, we pull this prank.
Okay, but then you buy my hats.

663
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,780
Yes.Yes. I'll buy them. But don't overdo it, otherwise
she will find out.

664
00:49:44,792 --> 00:49:48,320
No problem. Before, I used to play in a theatre in my country.

665
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:53,150
-They called me Will Smith from Zaire.
-Amazing.

666
00:49:57,917 --> 00:49:59,570
-Honey?
-Hi, love.

667
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:03,070
-I tried to reach you. How are you?
-Well, I'm asking you. Are you OK?

668
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:08,440
The best. A native is just showing me around. Watch.

669
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:12,990
Good day! Here's Doudou! We are in Tanzania!

670
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,042
She knows where we are.

671
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:19,400
-You are on a tour, although there was an earthquake?
-An earthquake? Alas, yes, earthquake ...

672
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:24,030
You know, it did not touch us here. Tanzania is a big country.

673
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:25,417
I was frightened to death!

674
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,630
They mentioned missing people. I thought I'll have another ex.

675
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,958
Very funny!

676
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:32,780
Do not worry. Doudou will take me to the hotel.

677
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:36,792
Yes, I'll take you to Sofitel ... in Tanzania.

678
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:41,780
-They put you in Sofitel? How posh!
-Well, could be worse.

679
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:43,240
What are your plans today?

680
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,150
I wanted to be by the pool, but it is full.
I'll just go to the beach.

681
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:47,990
Yes? Which beach?

682
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
It is called Zelos. Supposedly very nice.

683
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:55,860
-Cool!
-We're in Tanzania, no?

684
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:57,570
-Yes.
-We're in Tanzania.

685
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:59,940
Kisses, baby. We will return to the hotel.

686
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:02,550
-Kisses.
But we are in Tanzania!

687
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:05,660
We are in Tanzania!

688
00:51:06,292 --> 00:51:09,000
-I hung up.
-We are in Tanzania!

689
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,280
Good news. I told them about you in  Paris.
They want to meet you.

690
00:51:15,292 --> 00:51:17,250
-Yes? When?
-Now.

691
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:19,530
I can't, I got my stuff in the hotel.

692
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:22,280
We'll take them. They are very impatient.

693
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:23,990
Really?

694
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:26,792
I am so horny.

695
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:31,240
We're screwed. Flo is on her way here.

696
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,780
Stay here. Don't let her leave to the hotel, while we are there.

697
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:35,750
You can rely on me.

698
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:44,540
Just laugh. Remind me to never let you borrow my car.

699
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:52,500
-I apologize.
-For what?

700
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:57,490
- I have become so boring.
-Don't. You were always boring.

701
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,550
Stop it, you know...

702
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:04,110
Since retirement, I feel so unnecessary and  lifeless.

703
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:06,900
This is normal, work was everything to you.

704
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:09,280
You did exciting things.

705
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:13,990
You can still do exciting things.
Just remember what we did a minute ago.

706
00:52:14,542 --> 00:52:15,990
You know...

707
00:52:16,542 --> 00:52:18,990
if you had an affair ...

708
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:22,070
... I would understand.

709
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:24,330
Why do you say that?

710
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:28,550
-And you?
-I thought about it.

711
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:33,330
Is it true you stopped noticing me. We don't share anything.

712
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:36,990
But I never did it.

713
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,990
I love you too much.

714
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,990
I think I did well since you suprised me so pleasantly.

715
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:51,860
Yes ... let stop being sad and living in the past.

716
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:54,860
See. Let's say you are like that stone.

717
00:52:54,875 --> 00:52:57,330
-Flat?
-Yes. And not only that.

718
00:52:57,625 --> 00:53:01,330
It's up to you whether you sink or jump?.

719
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:04,990
Will you teach me?

720
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:06,770
Of course.

721
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:09,550
Here you are.

722
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:14,330
Bend your wrist and nicely along with the water.

723
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:19,990
Oh no! You didn't believe in yourself.
Be more optimistic.

724
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:21,660
Here, come on.

725
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:25,250
Yes!

726
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,833
Well... time to go.

727
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:38,792
Medicine against sun!

728
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:40,875
New sun protection.

729
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:43,830
Newest fashion from New York!

730
00:53:45,167 --> 00:53:47,667
Lady! A bracelet for your leg?

731
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:49,417
Sun protection?

732
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:51,958
Newest sun protection!

733
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:54,167
Hello, madam.

734
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,900
-Sun..
-Doudou?

735
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:57,650
No, I'm Baba.

736
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:00,792
Pardon me. I confused you with someone else.

737
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:06,110
-I like your garb.
-If you'd like, I have many for sale.

738
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:08,333
Great idea. Good.

739
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,625
Come on, pick up!

740
00:54:29,417 --> 00:54:31,958
Sofitel Zanzibar Airport.
How can I help you?

741
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,280
Hello, may I speak with Gregory Van Huffel?

742
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:36,792
Just a moment, please.

743
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:40,690
I'm sorry madam,
there is nobody like that.

744
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:43,650
Really?
He said he would be there.

745
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:47,660
I'm very sorry I can not find
any Gregory Van Huffel.

746
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:49,875
Okay, thank you.

747
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,042
We are here.

748
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:03,250
-Thank you, dear youth!
-No problem, oldies!

749
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:07,583
Do you remember?
That used to be fun.

750
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,167
More than 20 years ago.

751
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:41,375
No!
What's that music?

752
00:55:41,542 --> 00:55:42,690
Come.

753
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:43,550
Hey!

754
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:49,870
Didn't you say to stop
living in the past?

755
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,625
-What happened?
-Nothing,.

756
00:57:02,792 --> 00:57:05,780
My colleague hit a post yesterday.

757
00:57:05,792 --> 00:57:10,110
-Why did he stay?
-He had to take care of something important.

758
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:22,660
Nicely played!

759
00:57:24,292 --> 00:57:25,330
I beg your pardon?

760
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:28,990
That story with the malfunction...

761
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:31,820
-We really have a problem.
-Right.

762
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:35,330
And my breast is real.
Very cute!

763
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:39,208
Damn!

764
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:41,542
Sorry.

765
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,042
Alright?

766
00:57:47,292 --> 00:57:49,820
Mehdi? It's me.
I cannot reach Greg.

767
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:54,550
Did he really take Cynthia do Paris?
I lost Flo's parents.

768
00:57:55,792 --> 00:57:56,875
Please...

769
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:01,875
-Where are you going?
-Downtown Cannes.

770
00:58:02,042 --> 00:58:03,833
-Get in!
-Thanks.

771
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:12,440
-Where are you going dressed like this?
-Comic con. Will you come?

772
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:13,583
-Superheroes?
-Yes.

773
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:17,320
I can't. I have to get back.
Plus, I don't have a costume anyway.

774
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:18,780
Don't worry, we will find you something.

775
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:20,458
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

776
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,875
Strange taste. What is it?

777
00:58:26,042 --> 00:58:29,240
It's called Fantastic life.
Your life will seem fantastic!

778
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,320
Come with us. It'll be fun.

779
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:32,875
-Come.
-No, I can't.

780
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:34,280
Come!

781
00:58:34,292 --> 00:58:36,360
-No.
-Come,come, come!

782
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:39,875
Not. I really can't. Sorry, but no.

783
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,400
SUPERHERO PARTY

784
00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:32,375
What's up with Thor?
Is he drunk or what?

785
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:41,330
Amazing!

786
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,625
Wake up!

787
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,917
What am I dreaming?

788
00:59:57,083 --> 01:00:00,870
Good idea with the inflatable boat.

789
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:05,490
Brother! We will soon land in France.

790
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,750
-What's your name?
- Damn!

791
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,667
Police! Police!

792
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:19,500
Save yourself! Save yourself!

793
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:23,042
Wait.

794
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:27,700
Hide in  there. I'll distract them.

795
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,200
Many thanks. Thank you.

796
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:33,875
Go.

797
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:50,083
They hid in there! They are in there!

798
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,000
There are there!

799
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:57,550
-Stop, I am a Frenchman!
-Right. And I drink only water.

800
01:00:58,292 --> 01:01:01,125
-My knees hurt.
-My hips.

801
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:02,958
Flo? Are you here, honey?

802
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,708
Thanks for this evening, tomcat.

803
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:16,417
-Tomcat? It's been a long time.
-Yes, I know.

804
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:20,550
-I love you.
-I love you too, kitty.

805
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:30,417
Come closer ...

806
01:01:33,292 --> 01:01:36,792
Come on, tomcat! Water my flowers!

807
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:41,708
Do not move.

808
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:44,708
Stay like this.

809
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:47,625
Come! Come! Come!

810
01:01:47,792 --> 01:01:50,083
That's great!

811
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:58,990
Did you have a nice time at the beach, sweetie?

812
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:02,625
Hotel service.

813
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:05,458
I want to die ...

814
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:20,000
-For whom are the stuffed mussels?
-For me.

815
01:02:20,542 --> 01:02:22,990
Then the lobster tail  must be for the madam.

816
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:24,000
Here you are.

817
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:25,875
-Here.
-Thank you.

818
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:29,990
Miss, you really do not want anything?

819
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:33,550
You really want to talk with such hair-do?

820
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,000
Enjoy your meal.

821
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:38,330
-Honey, what it is?
-I said I am not hungry.

822
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:45,833
Well, it is about Greg.  I think that he is cheating.

823
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,490
What? How did you come up with that?

824
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,280
He was lying about Tanzania.

825
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:52,708
-He is not in the hotel.
-Did you call the correct hotel?

826
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:54,600
I called all of them.

827
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:56,110
Bastard...

828
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:59,770
And I believed him.

829
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:01,958
Hop! Jump. Hop!

830
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:10,780
-I am cold. Won't you hug me?
-I'd rather give you my jacket.

831
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:12,333
-Here.
-Come on, let's go!

832
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:15,042
Come, gadjo! Hop!

833
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,667
Give it to me. And go! Go to mom.

834
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:22,000
Thanks for helping us. You got us out of a big mess.

835
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:24,860
I'm Cynthia. Nice to meet you. And you?

836
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:30,070
I'm Marco Garcia of  the Garcia clan.
This little one here is my wife Josee.

837
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:31,958
Josee Garcia. Right, my dolphin?

838
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,440
Take a hike.

839
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,280
I like your chains. Are those mussels?

840
01:03:36,292 --> 01:03:39,530
No, these are teeth.
-Whose teeth?

841
01:03:39,542 --> 01:03:40,530
That depends.

842
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:43,250
This one here belongs to the one
who did this to me.

843
01:03:43,417 --> 01:03:45,625
Look at what he did to my car!

844
01:03:45,792 --> 01:03:48,110
Cannot remove it.
Fucking asshole!

845
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,625
Marco! Marco!

846
01:04:01,667 --> 01:04:03,667
I did not understand at all what he said.

847
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:10,190
What happened?

848
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:14,070
Some asshole stole our zebra and replaced with this.

849
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,080
Piche, show him what he put in  the cage.

850
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:24,990
But we have a video from the security camera,
that captured him.

851
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,375
-We'll catch the bastard, he'll end in a cement.
-In a cement!

852
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:36,280
We should get going, since  you are so busy.

853
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:38,917
Thank you for your hospitality ...

854
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,030
Absolutely not.

855
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:45,490
Garcia never lets anyone down.
We will watch the video and take you to a city.

856
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:49,690
-Your gadjo woman will not go through the woods in these pumps.
-Gadjo woman.

857
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:52,330
Thanks, nice of you. We aren't in a hurry.

858
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:58,870
We have a little problem. It was me who stole the zebra.

859
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:07,660
-Pardon me. Is there a bathroom?
-Go behind the caravan, it's nice and quiet there.

860
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:14,990
-I too have to go.
-Let her shit in peace.

861
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:40,750
That's him!

862
01:05:41,167 --> 01:05:42,958
Where is he?

863
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:44,083
Where is he?

864
01:05:44,917 --> 01:05:46,292
Open the goddamn door!

865
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:48,458
I do not know how!

866
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:50,910
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

867
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:52,990
I must think of my career.

868
01:06:04,917 --> 01:06:06,917
My Merc! You bastard!

869
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:29,910
-Do you want to steal my camper?
-No no no. Not at all.

870
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,292
You are dead!

871
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,280
This is a misunderstanding. Let me explain.

872
01:06:56,292 --> 01:06:57,550
My arm!

873
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:04,290
Who do you think you are?
Do know who I am? Do you?

874
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:06,667
I'll tear  you to pieces!

875
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:53,750
What are you doing here?

876
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:57,125
Why am I in the hospital?

877
01:07:57,292 --> 01:07:59,990
-Don't you remember?
-No.

878
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:02,042
You're here because you had an accident.

879
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,667
How long have I been unconscious?

880
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:07,792
-What's her name?
- Who?

881
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:11,050
-The with one with whom you weren't in Tanzania.
-What are you saying?

882
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:16,820
Greg, your problem is that you are a lousy liar.

883
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:20,690
I called all the hotels, no trace of Gregory Van Huffel.

884
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,880
Don't try to fool me or
the nightstand will end up in your  face.

885
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:28,110
Well...

886
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:31,458
I'll tell you the whole truth.

887
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:32,740
It's not true!

888
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,660
What is wrong with you?
He did not say anything.

889
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:37,542
Pardon me.

890
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:42,208
"Just you and it would be perfect."

891
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:45,110
"Just you and it would be perfect"
Did you not say that?

892
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:46,280
That's why I came earlier, to surprise you.

893
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:49,167
When you called me, I was not at the hotel.

894
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:51,150
When I came in, I could not get a cab.

895
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:53,990
The camper stopped and took me. Flo ...

896
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,990
Would I come if I cheated on you?

897
01:08:57,625 --> 01:09:02,440
Only an idiot would take his wife and mistress
to the same place.

898
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:03,330
Of course.

899
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:06,083
What are you doing?

900
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:10,550
If you really were in Tanzania, you are going to have a stamp.

901
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:27,860
I apologize for the misunderstanding,
Mr. Salem.

902
01:09:27,875 --> 01:09:28,740
But you know ...

903
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:31,660
Yes, it happens ... Good day.

904
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:40,125
Augustin?

905
01:09:40,292 --> 01:09:42,070
Sorry, I have no money.

906
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:43,740
No, it's me, Mehdi.
-Mehdi?

907
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:46,320
-Where's Greg?
-He left with Cynthia for Paris.

908
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:47,780
Finally some good news.

909
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:50,780
What are you wearing?
We were supposed to be inconspicuous.

910
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:53,330
Nobody will know with the way you look.

911
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:05,708
Let's go then.

912
01:10:15,417 --> 01:10:17,440
Finally, you are awake!

913
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:20,210
I'm sorry, but I have to do some more exams.

914
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:22,950
You can call off the vasectomy.

915
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:29,450
If you obey, I will come again in a nurse's uniform.

916
01:10:33,667 --> 01:10:35,030
You are a  good man.

917
01:10:35,042 --> 01:10:37,042
Here is something for fun.

918
01:10:47,667 --> 01:10:51,440
"My little Greg, after all that bad luck, I realized a lot of things.

919
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:54,610
I know how lucky I am to have a wife like Marlene.

920
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:57,030
I messed everything up and I am sorry.

921
01:10:57,042 --> 01:10:59,570
Therefore, our contract ends.
Thanks for everything.

922
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,690
PS: With Cynthia, it is over.

923
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:04,780
Poor thing just cried.

924
01:11:04,792 --> 01:11:08,900
I think it will take a while for her to recover. "

925
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:10,542
Michael!

926
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:12,792
Michael!

927
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:18,167
I found a room key in your jacket.

928
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:20,042
Michael?

929
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:23,650
I'm sorry that I left like that.

930
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:25,542
I would like to apologize.

931
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:27,330
Great job with the passport.

932
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:30,240
Thank Mehdi. He reminded me of it.

933
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,610
I like that guy.

934
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:34,583
-It was a close shave.
-Oh yes.

935
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,500
ALIBI for Gerard MARTIN

936
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,000
Wife doesn't  know about his mistress

937
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
LOVER singer?

938
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:02,750
Hello?

939
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:04,990
Good afternoon, on Sunday I would like to

940
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,190
meet a young woman, very discreetly.

941
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:10,610
I was told that you can help me.

942
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:13,860
-Are you married?
-Yes.

943
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:17,280
-And do you still love her?
-I think so, yes.

944
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:20,320
-Then why do you want to do it?
-Pardon?

945
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:23,360
Listen.  I will give you some advice ...

946
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:24,990
Let it be.

947
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:28,220
You would definitely regret it.

948
01:12:28,292 --> 01:12:30,660
Excuse me, I cannot help you.

949
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:34,440
-Good-bye.
- Okay ... Bye.

950
01:12:38,417 --> 01:12:40,833
Your scooter is ready, Mr. President.

951
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
YOU WILL REGRET THAT YOU FUCKED WITH ME!

952
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:52,940
-Hello?
-Greg, we're fucked.

953
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:56,400
-Some stole our computer with all the files.
-It was Cynthia.

954
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:59,490
I know, we saw her on the security camera.

955
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,690
The receptionist  said she took a taxi to the airport.

956
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:05,360
We need to get that computer,
otherwise we are dead.

957
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:06,958
Hurry to the airport. I'm going there too.

958
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:36,875
Bastard! You are so dead! Wait!

959
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:47,583
Stop!

960
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,800
-Give me your car or I'll pummel you!
-Sorry, but I will not give you my car.

961
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:56,208
Come on ...

962
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:57,792
-Get out!
-Wait!

963
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:58,833
I'll put you in a cement, you asshole!

964
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,000
FLO CALLING

965
01:15:57,667 --> 01:16:01,000
Hands up! Come on! Slowly.

966
01:16:11,292 --> 01:16:14,570
Alibi.com, company founded by Gregory Van Huffel,

967
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:17,792
helped paying customers  fool others.

968
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:23,780
But now  their top secret customer list
was published on the internet.

969
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:26,860
by Cynthia Belinni, one of the victims of this company.

970
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:32,740
There are many celebrities from show business and politics
among its victims.

971
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:36,320
We wish a lot of luck to all the customers of Alibi.com,

972
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,660
because they will need it.

973
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,500
What's the surprise?

974
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
BOARDING SCHOOL St. John

975
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,583
OK. Scream loudly!

976
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:59,000
Abstinence. A-B-S-T-I-N-E-N-C-E.

977
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:45,000
Van Huffel! You can go. See you in court.

978
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:55,750
Flo, it's me. Open up!

979
01:18:55,917 --> 01:18:58,000
Father told me you were here.

980
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:00,333
Flo!

981
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:10,610
-Flo, I need to talk to you.
-What for?

982
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:13,320
When I lied because of my company,
it was because

983
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:15,610
I was afraid that you would leave me

984
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:18,570
When Gerard came in, I did not know
that he was your father.

985
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:21,240
Then it was too late, I could not back out.

986
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,530
I thought you were the right one,
the one who will make me happy.

987
01:19:24,542 --> 01:19:26,208
But you hurt me the most.

988
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:27,667
You must give me another chance.

989
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:30,208
Too late.  I'm with someone else.

990
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:32,490
So it's over?

991
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,530
It is not possible.
We are made for each other.

992
01:19:35,542 --> 01:19:39,000
Like Brandon and Kelly
in  Beverly Hills.

993
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,208
Who?

994
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:49,290
I told you I moved on.

995
01:19:49,792 --> 01:19:52,550
Imagine, we got the flat.

996
01:19:57,417 --> 01:20:01,550
And Beverly Hills ... Kelly has decided for Dylan.

997
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,990
Are you normal? Who are you are?

998
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,570
-Drop me off behind the corner.
-It does work for me, I'm waiting for my girlfriend ...

999
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:24,880
Do not get on my nerves! The sooner you move,
the quicker you are done!

1000
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:25,880
Hello, Mr.!

1001
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:29,167
Yes, kiddo?

1002
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:32,660
Because of you, my parents are getting a divorce. Moron!

1003
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:39,070
Wouldn't you rather take the bus?
-Go already, damn it!

1004
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:40,417
Okay, but ...

1005
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
REJECTED

1006
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:18,958
Will he buy out all the kiosk?

1007
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:20,667
Don't know.

1008
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,042
I have never seen him like this.

1009
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,650
How could you forgive him? I admire you.

1010
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:29,530
You know, honey,

1011
01:21:29,542 --> 01:21:33,292
we forgive as much as we love.
And I love your father.

1012
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,990
The most beautiful flowers for the most beautiful woman.

1013
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:45,292
-Isn't that Maurice?
-Yeah, with his son.

1014
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,792
Go on, I'll bring the crepes.

1015
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:55,410
-What can I do for you?
-Three crepes with sugar.

1016
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,550
Something to drink?

1017
01:22:06,417 --> 01:22:07,125
No.

1018
01:22:07,292 --> 01:22:08,083
Van Huffel!

1019
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:13,280
-Yes?
-Four years!

1020
01:22:13,292 --> 01:22:16,150
Pardon?
-She cheated on me for four years, thanks to you.

1021
01:22:16,167 --> 01:22:18,917
-I'm sorry. But for me that's past.

1022
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:20,750
No.

1023
01:22:20,917 --> 01:22:21,917
Slowly. It is...

1024
01:22:28,208 --> 01:22:29,490
Listen, guys ...

1025
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:32,110
If you want money, I don't have anything, business is closed.

1026
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:35,940
Your money is irrelevant. I want you to regret this.

1027
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:38,000
I'm sorry.

1028
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:40,240
Believe me, I lost the love of my  life.

1029
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:42,333
You deserved that, asshole!

1030
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:46,167
Stop!

1031
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,083
What are you laughing about, jerk?

1032
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:56,860
I am lucky that I met you.

1033
01:22:56,875 --> 01:22:58,042
What?

1034
01:22:58,208 --> 01:23:02,500
I lost the love of my life. Why should I continue?

1035
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,570
If it makes you happy, go ahead and hit me.

1036
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:08,150
Finish it up.
What are you waiting for?

1037
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:10,167
He's crazy.

1038
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:11,900
What are you waiting for?
Here I am.

1039
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:14,780
Forget it. He is nuts and  smells of booze.

1040
01:23:14,792 --> 01:23:16,875
I say to finish this! Come on!

1041
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:10,083
Idiot!

1042
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:11,042
Flo?

1043
01:24:11,208 --> 01:24:13,750
Flo! Are you OK?

1044
01:24:13,917 --> 01:24:17,440
I can confirm, nobody has hurt me more than you.

1045
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:19,542
Damn!

1046
01:24:21,042 --> 01:24:22,610
Such cowards!

1047
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:25,320
I hope there are cameras to catch them.

1048
01:24:25,333 --> 01:24:28,410
I hope so.  At least I have improved
my Van Damme's kick.

1049
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:34,190
Flo, what do I need to do
for you forgive me?

1050
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:35,333
Let myself be whipped?

1051
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,400
Go on holiday with Maurice?

1052
01:24:37,417 --> 01:24:39,550
Lose in bowling?

1053
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:42,990
Promise that you will never ever
lie to me again.

1054
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:44,667
I promise.

1055
01:24:45,542 --> 01:24:47,550
Have I told you that I love you?

1056
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:49,458
No.

1057
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:51,330
How foolish of me.

1058
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:05,900
-There were three of them?
-Three workers.

1059
01:25:05,917 --> 01:25:09,360
I'm disgusted.
We should never leave him alone.

1060
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:10,990
I would knock him out.

1061
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,940
After Alibi.com, what do you do now?

1062
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:16,900
We have a business that saves broken relationships.

1063
01:25:16,917 --> 01:25:17,900
How is it going?

1064
01:25:17,917 --> 01:25:20,330
I'll just say that I don't have
live with my mother anymore.

1065
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:22,990
We have  quite a few customers.

1066
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:26,900
You are sexy with the broken mouth!

1067
01:25:26,917 --> 01:25:29,330
Why do you think I hit  you?

1068
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:31,990
I missed you, silly man.

1069
01:25:32,167 --> 01:25:33,330
Me too.

1070
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:47,500
Want to be together again?

1071
01:25:54,667 --> 01:25:55,660
What?
