1
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:15,416
This is Auradon,

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,708
the kingdom where all your
favorite fairy tales are true.

3
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,875
It was formed 30 years ago,
when Beast married Belle.

4
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,833
And how do you think they got
all those characters to coexist?

5
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:25,916
Simple.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,458
By banishing the villains
to the Isle of the Lost.

7
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,708
That's where I grew up.

8
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,291
You might know my name.

9
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:34,666
Uma, daughter of the big,
bad sea witch, Ursula,

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,833
and a pirate queen
not to be messed with.

11
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:40,250
I helped Mal and
Ben free the isle,

12
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:44,166
and now that they're on the throne,
things are a lot more fair around here.

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,291
But they're sailing off with
Jay and Evie on a new adventure,

14
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,625
forming alliances
with distant lands.

15
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,083
And guess who they left in
charge while they're gone?

16
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,541
That's right. Villains rule.

17
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,625
And you can bet I'm gonna
shake things up around here.

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,791
Mmm.

19
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:16,500
Ooh. I've been to the principal's
office before, but never like this.

20
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:17,583
I made us tea.

21
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:19,708
Mmm.

22
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,125
Sit, please.

23
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,041
Oh, it's not an easy job, Uma.

24
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,041
But I hope you
find it fulfilling.

25
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,416
Hmm.

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,458
I've run a crew of cut-throats
since I was sixteen.

27
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,750
I think I can handle a
few prep school kids.

28
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,333
Pirates!

29
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,041
You just enjoy retirement.

30
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,416
I'm not retiring. I...

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,833
Are you sure you wanna
put that up there?

32
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,125
Arrr!

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,750
I've been chosen as the new
president of Auradon University,

34
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,208
and to ensure a
seamless transition,

35
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:04,625
I have prepared a list,

36
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,750
color-coded by priority.

37
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,541
My first order of business
will be making sure kids

38
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,958
from all the kingdoms
are welcome to attend AP.

39
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,458
Oh, well, that's already
our school policy.

40
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,333
I said "all."

41
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,541
Even Wonderland.

42
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,916
Wonderland? No.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,083
Oh, no.

44
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,625
Wonderland is hostile.

45
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,416
I've heard. Their
queen's a tyrant.

46
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,541
The Queen of Hearts refused to
join Auradon when we united.

47
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,250
She raised an army and we had
to wall off the rabbit hole.

48
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,500
Oh, dear.

49
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,791
If only Queen Mal and
King Ben were here.

50
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,166
Well, too bad they're not.

51
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,208
And why do you think
Mal put me in charge

52
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,666
if she didn't wanna shake
things up around here?

53
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,166
No offense, Fairy G, but you
don't know Mal and Ben like I do.

54
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,083
I used to hate Mal.

55
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,833
I'm sure you've heard, but
you know what happened?

56
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:01,958
We reconciled.

57
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,833
We saw the goodness
in each other.

58
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,583
When she and Ben finally
opened up the Isle,

59
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,708
they gave all villains
a second chance.

60
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,916
It's time Wonderland
got one too.

61
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,541
This is for Princess Red.

62
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,541
Are you sure?

63
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,375
It's what Carlos
would have wanted.

64
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,041
So don't do it for me.

65
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,416
Do it in honor of him.

66
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,083
Mmm.

67
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,916
Hey.

68
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:58,250
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

69
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,041
That's right.

70
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:14,541
Auradon may have brought down the barrier,
but they still left one VK behind.

71
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,333
Not on my watch.

72
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,750
So, I'm sending an invite...

73
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,958
to the kingdom no one
dares to talk about.

74
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,666
The one that lurks
right below the surface.

75
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:34,958
Wonderland, a dark world
of mystery and magic.

76
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,916
And its ruler, the
Queen of Hearts,

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,666
well, she's got a reputation
for being downright ruthless.

78
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,750
Subjects of Wonderland,

79
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,166
you have one minute to comply

80
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,833
with her Royal Majesty's
curfew, or else...

81
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,666
Or else, it's off
with your head.

82
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:59,583
There's only one person who dares
to resist the Queen's orders.

83
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,375
And that's her
very own daughter,

84
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,708
Princess Red.

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Maddox!

153
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,000
Those guards could have dragged
you to the dungeon, Red.

154
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,291
- Phew!
- What on earth were you thinking?

155
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,791
That my mom's portrait
could use a little touch-up.

156
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,916
I am seriously worried
about you, Red.

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,166
I hope she likes it.

158
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,583
If you continue down this path, I
won't always be there to save you.

159
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,666
You know that, right?

160
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,041
Maddox Hatter, you
know you can't save me.

161
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,958
I'm a prisoner of
Wonderland. I'm a lost cause.

162
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,958
You are not a lost cause.

163
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,625
As your tutor, I'm in charge of
preparing you for your future.

164
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,750
And as your friend,

165
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:38,958
I want you to have one.

166
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,541
What future, Mads?

167
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:45,125
I literally have the most
controlling mom ever.

168
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,125
She's never gonna let
me leave Wonderland.

169
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:51,416
I know it hasn't been easy growing
up with a mother that's so...

170
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,666
particular.

171
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,791
But she wasn't always this way.

172
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,166
It's true!

173
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,333
We're all products of our past,

174
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,708
and your mother's was
certainly unfortunate.

175
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,666
She just wants to turn me into
the next evil queen like her.

176
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,708
And I don't wanna be Queen.

177
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:14,625
I just wanna be in
charge of my own life.

178
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,250
But what I want
doesn't matter to her.

179
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,166
Oh, Red...

180
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,125
I wasn't going to
show you this...

181
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,625
until you were a little older,

182
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,541
but I finished it.

183
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,666
Hmm!

184
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,833
My time machine.

185
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,791
It takes you to
the moment in time

186
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,833
that can give you what
your heart wants most.

187
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:56,083
If you really want a different life,
Red, I want you to have that choice.

188
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,500
But I should warn you,

189
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,500
when you alter the
fabric of time,

190
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,416
there can be some
unpredictable consequences.

191
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,333
- I think I can live with that.
- Everything could change.

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You could lose your
mother entirely.

193
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,708
It's too dangerous.

194
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,250
Not yet.

195
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,625
When you're more mature.

196
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,666
I know you're frustrated, Red, but
I'm trying to look out for you.

197
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,541
I care about you very much.

198
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,375
- Thanks, Mads.
- Oh.

199
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,541
At least someone still does.

200
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,333
Search the castle!

201
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,666
Well, if the Queen finds out
I'm harboring a fugitive,

202
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,500
I'll be in some serious trouble.

203
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,000
You best get out of here, Red.

204
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,416
- I dare you to make me.
- As you wish, Princess.

205
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,666
What'd I say about
calling me... Princess?

206
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:55,958
Mmm.

207
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:28,583
But I should warn you, you
could lose your mother entirely.

208
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Where you going?

209
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,833
Get back here!

210
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,708
Gotcha now!

211
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,916
No! No.

212
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Got ya!

213
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,750
Bet you didn't see that coming.

214
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,250
Dad, that's cheating.

215
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,375
No.

216
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,833
That's delicious.

217
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,458
Don't be so serious, Chloe.

218
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,958
We signed you up for Swords and Shields,
'cause it was supposed to be fun.

219
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:33,375
Well, yeah, it is, but when I'm out
there, I'm not just another competitor.

220
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,041
I represent Cinderellasburg.

221
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,166
You sound like your mother.

222
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,070
Don't listen to him.

223
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,666
Your father's never cared
about what other people think.

224
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,666
I don't have to. I'm charming.

225
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,250
Oh, that's debatable.

226
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,625
Dad.

227
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,416

You know, this is the first song

237
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,250
your mom and I ever danced to
back when we were in school.

238
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,333
We fell in love at Castlecoming.

239
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,916
Yeah, I know. You
tell me every time.

240
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,958
And I know you guys have a healthy
relationship and all, but come on.

241
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,875
And it's a good thing, too,

242
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,791
or we wouldn't have been able
to create this amazing family.

243
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,333
I know you packed last night,

244
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,416
but you think you might have
room for one more pair of shoes?

245
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:02,250
Mom! They're just like
yours! But even cooler.

246
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,291
You earned them, Chloe.

247
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,125
You got straight A's last year.

248
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,833
And volunteered for the
Auradon Historical Society.

249
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,958
And the thing I'm most proud of
is that you're such a good person.

250
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,916
That's why you're
a great princess,

251
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,041
and why you'll
make a great queen.

252
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,583
These are some
big shoes to fill.

253
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,416
Are you gonna try
'em on or what?

254
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,416
Her Royal Highness!

255
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,833
Her Grace!

256
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,291
Her Excellency!

257
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,916
Her magnanimous Majesty,

258
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,708
Empress of Wonderland,

259
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,458
the Queen of Hearts!

260
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,916
Your Majesty.

261
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,416
Who is responsible?

262
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,601
We don't know, Your
Royal Highness.

263
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,041
I've doubled the guard,
tripled the patrol,

264
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,000
and personally offered ten
diamonds for any information

265
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,375
that leads to the
capture of the criminal.

266
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,416
Her Royal Highness,

267
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,083
Princess Red!

268
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,625
Oh. I see you couldn't be
bothered to dress for court.

269
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:26,208
I find that outfit... offensive.

270
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,791
I wish being me
didn't offend you.

271
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,125
Sorry to rouse you out
of bed before noon,

272
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,875
but while you were sleeping,
the Royal Plaza was vandalized.

273
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,250
And this sorry
excuse for a soldier

274
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,291
failed to protect my portrait.

275
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,708
So, the question
is, what do we do?

276
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,458
Poke thorns in his eyes?

277
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,166
Off with his head?

278
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,208
Since you'll be queen one
day, I'll let you decide.

279
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,958
- It's up to me?
- Mmm.

280
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,375
Okay.

281
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,666
Well, in that case...

282
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,208
Off with his...

283
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,583
Hat.

284
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Ugh!

285
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,541
You're such a disappointment.

286
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,500
You know, I was the
same way at your age.

287
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:39,083
Desperately wanting to be a
queen that everyone would adore.

288
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:44,083
But if I've learned
anything, it's this.

289
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,166
It's better to be
feared than loved.

290
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,958
Love ain't it.

291
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,333
Now, try again.

292
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
For your crime,

293
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,833
you are sentenced to...

294
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,708
Get it right or I'll
show you punishment!

295
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,541
I beg your pardon!

296
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:21,666
Apologies for interrupting
court, Your Majesty.

297
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,875
Royal Delivery.

298
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,208
Dear Queen of Hearts,
Empress of Wonderland.

299
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,791
As the new principal
of Auradon Prep,

300
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:41,333
it is my honor to invite your daughter,
Red, the Princess of Wonderland,

301
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,708
to attend our school.

302
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,583
I hope you'll join us for
the Welcome Day ceremony.

303
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:49,500
If you accept, this invitation
shall serve as your key.

304
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,500
"From pirate to principal."

305
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,583
Another villain's gone soft.

306
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,541
Maybe you have a
future, after all.

307
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:03,583
If you go to Auradon Prep,
you get to leave Wonderland.

308
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,833
It doesn't matter.

309
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:16,833
The only thing she hates more than Auradon
is the idea of me having my own life.

310
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,708
So, I'm pretty sure
that's gonna be a "no."

311
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,208
We accept!

312
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,375
Wait, hold on.

313
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,583
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

314
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,291
But you've always said
that Auradon is the worst.

315
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,625
Well, with my daughter there,
it might not always be.

316
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,541
You're gonna let me go? You?

317
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,166
Pack your bags.

318
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,166
Am I hallucinating or did
my mom just grow a heart?

319
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,666
And put on something
respectable, for once.

320
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,291
Don't embarrass me!

321
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,375
Okay, half a heart.

322
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,708
They fit perfectly!

323
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,916
- I love them.
- There's my girl.

324
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,500
Thank you.

325
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,823
It's so beautiful.

326
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,875
Are you sure you can't come?

327
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,375
I mean, we can visit Chad
at college another time.

328
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,583
He really wants me to come

329
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,500
- see him play tourney, so...
- Mmm-hmm.

330
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,416
- Take care of your mom for me?
- I will.

331
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,708
Love you.

332
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,750
So, how do we get
into the rabbit hole?

333
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,416
It's been locked for decades.

334
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,250
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Oh, you have so much to learn.

335
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,833
Finally.

336
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,000
Oh, Red,

337
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:35,000

523
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,250
My school. My life.

524
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,083
Someday, you'll thank me.

525
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:05,416
Oh!

526
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
And we've already
seen the ending.

527
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:10,416
Spoiler alert... We win.

528
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:14,116
Stop it, Bridget!

529
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:16,916
You're better than this!

530
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:19,041
Let her through.

531
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,291
This is too far.

532
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:25,166
I know that what happened was hard
for you, but that was ages ago.

533
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,833
It feels like yesterday to me.

534
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,708
It was a stupid prank.

535
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,541
Stupid, I could forgive.

536
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:40,708
Humiliating a girl
at her first dance,

537
00:30:40,791 --> 00:30:43,708
turning me into a monster
in front of everyone.

538
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:45,666
Now, that's just cruel.

539
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,625
You're right.

540
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:51,375
You didn't care then.

541
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,000
You were off with your prince.

542
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,083
Ooh, but you will now.

543
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:59,458
You will all show me
the respect I deserve!

544
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:01,541
Get back!

545
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:04,375
Now kneel.

546
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:13,916
I will never kneel to a tyrant.

547
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,500
She's denied a royal order.

548
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:21,541
What do we do about
that, darling?

549
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,291
Look, all you have to
do is swear allegiance.

550
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:28,666
Is that so hard?

551
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:33,416
If it means compromising
everything I stand for, yes.

552
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,458
Who are you loyal to, Red?

553
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,208
These strangers...

554
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:44,625
or your mother?

555
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,208
Hmm?

556
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:51,333
Now make me proud, for once.

557
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:54,833
Come on, Bridget,

558
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,000
even your daughter
knows it's wrong.

559
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,833
She can't do it.

560
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:14,833
Treason.

561
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,666
She's guilty of treason.

562
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,958
Exactly right, my dear.

563
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:24,666
And that means
off with her head!

564
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:33,375
Shoo!

565
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:43,833
- Mom?
- It's gonna be okay, Chloe.

566
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:45,416
- Mom? Mom!
- I love you.

567
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,583
It's gonna be okay.

568
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,333
- Mom!
- Be brave, Chloe.

569
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:52,125
Mom? No. No!

570
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:54,041
I knew you had it in you.

571
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:55,541
Let her go!

572
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:58,500
You'll be a great
queen, after all.

573
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:06,250
Look at her. She's
enjoying this.

574
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:07,750
Like mother, like daughter.

575
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,416
Hey, that's not
fair. Let her go!

576
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,333
- Oh, bless your heart.
- Let her go!

577
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:26,750
Wait.

578
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:57,833
What just happened?
Where did everybody go?

579
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,500
Whoa.

580
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:03,833
It works.

581
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,666
What works? Where are we?

582
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:08,416
Not where.

583
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:10,791
When.

584
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:16,583
Bibbidi... Bobbidi... Boo.

585
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:24,250
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

586
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:28,791
No. I wanted to speed-read, not
for my reading to speed off...

587
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:31,541
Hi. Excuse me, where
did everybody go?

588
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:32,708
Every-who?

589
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:35,458
All the royal families of
Auradon. They were here.

590
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:36,875
What's Auradon?

591
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:40,958
I gotta go catch my homework.

592
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,166
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

593
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,684
Everybody's heard of Auradon.

594
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:48,291
And the only person who says
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo is Fairy Godmother.

595
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:50,791
Maybe she's not a godmother yet?

596
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,166
What do you mean?

597
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,333
Look around you.

598
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:57,500
Fairy Godmother sucks at magic.

599
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:00,958
Auradon doesn't
exist, which means...

600
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:06,458
Really? I thought
you were smart.

601
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,208
We're back in time.

602
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:12,791
No.

603
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:16,791
Wait.

604
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:18,833
No.

605
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:23,500
- How?
- This is a time machine.

606
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,166
- You're joking.
- Does it look like I'm joking?

607
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:30,833
Why would you take
us back in time?

608
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:32,500
I didn't take you.

609
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:34,416
You just grabby-grabbed
your way in.

610
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,583
And this is not
what I had in mind.

611
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,625
I just wanted to stop my mom.

612
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:43,041
What about my mom? You
sentenced her to death.

613
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,958
Maybe not my finest moment,

614
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:47,000
- but I'm gonna fix it.
- How?

615
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,541
I thought the watch would take
me back a couple of minutes

616
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,791
so that I could steal
my mom's deck of cards.

617
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,416
Not a couple decades.

618
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,458
Well, we need to go
back and save my mom.

619
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:58,333
No, the watch sent us to
this time for a reason.

620
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:00,833
Give me that.

621
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,291
I don't need the help of some
princess goody two shoes.

622
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,625

00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,916
Of course. Merlin Academy.

Prep used to be called.

Sorry, I'm busy

692
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:11,833
Okay, remember what your mom said about
being humiliated at her first dance?

693
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:13,291
This must be what she meant.

694
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,250
If someone did some
horrible prank to her...

695
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:19,125
Maybe that's what turned her
into a terrible dictator?

696
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:25,708
That must be why the watch sent
us back to this moment in time.

697
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:29,250
It's before my mom
turns into... My mom.

698
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:32,375
Great. Now, how do we stop that?

699
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:35,875
By figuring out who's gonna do
the prank that ruins her life.

700
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:50,041
Late for class, ladies?

701
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:51,208
Stay right there.

702
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:52,666
Oh, my gosh, it's Merlin.

703
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:00,125
Actually, we're not students.

704
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,500
Well, we are, but we think
that we've been sent...

705
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:05,833
Sent from another place.

706
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:07,791
We're transfer students.

707
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:13,125
Well, I'm Principal Merlin, so,
I should have received papers.

708
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:15,708
Now, yes, is it that one?

709
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,750
No. This one?

710
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:22,958
"Dear Mum..." No,
that's... that's not it.

711
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:24,666
Um, uh...

712
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,916
Well, then, that's...

713
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,666
Ooh, ooh! Ah.

714
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,916
That's... That's not safe.

715
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,541
It's not safe at all. Ooh.

716
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:32,833
Eh... Um...

717
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:35,000
I'm sure it'll
turn up eventually.

718
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:39,791
I founded this Academy to be an
educational institution for all.

719
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:45,875
But you must know that we have a
no-swords policy in the classroom.

720
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:50,208
I've transported it to the Stardust
Room, which will be your dormitory.

721
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:53,625
I'll settle you in after school,
but first let's get you to class.

722
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:56,625
I teach Honors
Alchemy in my office.

723
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:57,750
Right this way.

724
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,166
No, that's... Sorry,
it's this way. This way.

725
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:03,541
Follow me!

726
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:09,000
- The marble in these archways...
- What was that?

727
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:11,916
The Auradon Code of Conduct forbids
lying. Especially to teachers.

728
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,666
Good thing this
isn't Auradon yet.

729
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,833
There are no swords
in these stones.

730
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,125
Here we are.

731
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,583
Um, key, key. Where's the key?

732
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,416
Ah. Yeah.

733
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,000
Here we go. Right. That's it.

734
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,166
Let's do alchemy!

735
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,125
So, plants are still alive.

736
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:40,000
Flasks are bubbling.

737
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:42,166
Bubbling, bubbling.

738
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,541
All right, class,
let's get started.

739
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:55,666
We have two new
transfers here today,

740
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:59,458
so let's at least pretend
that this is an Honors class.

741
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:01,625
Um, Bridget and Ella,

742
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:05,000
split up and help
these two get sorted,

743
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,416
- won't you?
- Hmm.

744
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Here you are.

745
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:11,000
- Try not to burn it this time.
- Bridget?

746
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:13,041
- Yeah.
- Mom?

747
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:16,000
Um...

748
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:19,416
I mean, uh, Ella, hi.

749
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,375
Nice... Nice to meet you.

750
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:26,208
Okay, new girl, let's dive in.

751
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,333
So, wait. You're Bridget?

752
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:35,291
Mmm-hmm.

753
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:37,000
Bridget from Wonderland?

754
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:38,583
Yup. That's me.

755
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:45,083
Ah. There we go.

756
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:47,333
Okay, so...

757
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:54,750
Oh, wow, those are gross.

758
00:43:56,666 --> 00:43:59,208
Come on, these pods
don't drain themselves.

759
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,750
Could you pass the griffin-claw
please? I gotta stir this up.

760
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:09,166
I love your outfit, by the way.

761
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,791
Why are you talking like that?

762
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:12,250
Like what?

763
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:15,666
You just sound different.

764
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,333
I'm not quite sure I...

765
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,916
No, it's me. I'm... You're...

766
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,916
This is all just a lot.

767
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:24,791
Sorry, I just...

768
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,291
I never had to... Oh! Ew!

769
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,166
- Ew!
- You okay?

770
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,791
- Yeah. Sorry, I just...
- Keep the chatter down, please.

771
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:38,166
You're not what I was expecting.

772
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,166
You never worked with
someone who's not royalty?

773
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:44,166
Worried a commoner
might rub off on you?

774
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,250
No.

775
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:51,833
How many kids were
at your old school?

776
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Uh...

777
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:56,208
One.

778
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:59,166
I was homeschooled too.

779
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,666
Until I came here.

780
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,583
So, you know, don't worry,
you'll get used to it.

781
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:05,000
Do you want a hug?

782
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:07,333
Not really a hugger.

783
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,833
I've got the perfect thing
to make you feel better.

784
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:14,666
I made 'em this morning.

785
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,125
Keep those flasks
bubbling, please.

786
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,416
Fabulous Flamingo-Feather
Cupcakes.

787
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:23,083
Flamingo feathers?

788
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,791
Don't worry. They don't bite.

789
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:29,250
Not like those gingerbread
men I made last spring.

790
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:31,583
I won't be using
that cookbook again.

791
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:33,375
Try one.

792
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,416
Whoa!

793
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,875
These are fabulous.

794
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:50,833
Ah, ah, ah.

795
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:54,458
Just one or there
can be side effects.

796
00:45:57,166 --> 00:46:00,583
Now, ready to tackle
the assignment?

797
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:02,083
Why are you so nice?

798
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:07,458

sugar than salt.

869
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:52,500
I mean, flamingo feathers
are, like, super rare, right?

870
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:53,750
Hey!

871
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:55,958
- Give that back to her!
- I'm sorry.

872
00:49:56,958 --> 00:49:59,708
I don't speak peasant girl.

873
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:01,208
I love your outfit by the way.

874
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:04,666
It is just so put together.

875
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:08,666
That was wicked, Uli.

876
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:11,041
You said, "put together"
'cause it's not.

877
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:12,791
My name's Bridget

878
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:15,833
and I have to bribe people
with treats to be my friend

879
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:18,500
because I'm such a loner.

880
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:23,666
Hey! The Code of Conduct
prohibits theft and bullying!

881
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,541
Easy, lass.

882
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:29,750
I dunno where you come from, but here
we don't fight until after school.

883
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:31,000
Meet me then.

884
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:32,541
You wouldn't stand a chance.

885
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:37,833
Listen, squid-face,

886
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:39,791
give the cupcakes back

887
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:42,875
or I'll rip that magic
tongue out of your throat.

888
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,333
Oh, girl.

889
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:48,333
I only wanted the feathers.

890
00:50:48,416 --> 00:50:50,083
You can have the rest.

891
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:57,875
Wait! That's too many!

892
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:03,333
Mmm.

893
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:06,541
You shouldn't have done that.

894
00:51:08,916 --> 00:51:10,125
I'm sorry.

895
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:15,833
You are just jealous
of my fabulosity.

896
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:17,416
Okay?

897
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,833
You can't handle my...

898
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,750
What was...

899
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:26,000
What was that?

900
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:31,375
You all right, Uli?

901
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:33,541
You're looking a little pink.

902
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:34,625
Shut up!

903
00:51:39,916 --> 00:51:41,500
What's happening to me?

904
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:44,583
Will someone help her!

905
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:46,333
Yeah, someone should help her.

906
00:51:49,416 --> 00:51:50,416
Uli, I...

907
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,416
- We... okay.
- Yeah.

908
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,291
Thanks.

909
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:07,375
- Wait.
- Uli!

910
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,750
I tried to warn you.

911
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:18,833
Bridget, run.

912
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,476
Okay, okay, we're almost there.

913
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,000
Hey there, darling!

914
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:30,000
- I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.
- What?

915
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:32,125
I want to have a little
chat with your friend.

916
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:34,958
I'm sorry. I told
you to be careful.

917
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:36,833
Hey! Bridget!

918
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:37,916
Watch out!

919
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:48,041
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

920
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:49,333
Come on.

921
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:58,208
Oh, my...

922
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:02,250
Where's Bridget?

923
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:05,083
So, pretty sure we just found
out who's gonna do the prank.

924
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:08,041
I don't know, maybe
that wasn't so bad?

925
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:10,416
I will destroy her!

926
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:15,041
Maybe it was.

927
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:20,375
Tell Bridget this isn't over!

928
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:25,208
How's Uli doing?

929
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:27,166
I feel terrible.

930
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:30,875
- I should go apologize.
- Don't

931
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,500
She did it to herself.

932
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:34,958
And it serves her right.

933
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,625
She's always bullying us.

934
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:41,333
Ella, yo, that was amazing.

935
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:44,333
You ladies bested Uliana!

936
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:46,791
I don't think anyone's
ever done that before.

937
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,833
And that makes you
braver than I am.

938
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:50,833
And I'm a prince.

939
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:53,500
Though I don't really like
to push the royal angle.

940
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:56,333
Yet you always find a way.

941
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,750
You're the new girls,
right? I'm Charming.

942
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:01,583
That's debatable.

943
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:03,684
You picked the right
time to show up

944
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,458
because it's Castlecoming week.

945
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:11,041
Castlecoming is an
outdated, elitist tradition.

946
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:12,375
Does that mean you're not...

947
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:15,833
Squeezing into a super-expensive
dress and painful shoes?

948
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:18,041
No thanks.

949
00:54:19,416 --> 00:54:23,041
Well, if you happen
to change your mind,

950
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:25,541
I'll see you there.

951
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:31,416
Hey, Ella.

952
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:34,750
He seemed pretty interested in
your plans for the festival.

953
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:37,000
Was I sensing some chemistry?

954
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:38,750
Uh, no.

955
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:42,375
Okay, yeah, everyone loves him,

956
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:46,000
and sure, he's gorgeous
and he seems nice,

957
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,875
but you know how royalty is,

958
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:50,041
well, except for you, B.

959
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:51,291
You're different.

960
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:55,583
I just wish someone was that
interested in going with me.

961
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:57,958
Everyone already
has plans, so...

962
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:04,208
Bridget, will you go to
Castlecoming with me?

963
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:05,791
But, you just said...

964
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:07,958
Yeah, I despise
everything it stands for.

965
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:13,833
But if we go as friends, maybe
it won't be totally awful.

966
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:17,291
We have to try on
dresses right now!

967
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:18,916
We only have two days.

968
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,041
I can't, I have
to get back home.

969
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,875
- But maybe later.
- Okay.

970
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:26,958
- See you later. Bye!
- Bye.

971
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:29,250
Gonna find the perfect dress.

972
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:32,791
I better get home.

973
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:40,625
Two days until my
mom gets pranked.

974
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:42,041
It's not enough time.

975
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:43,333
It's gonna have to be.

976
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,625
I just... I can't believe
my mom was so sweet.

977
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:52,291
Tell me about it.

978
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:56,708
My mom's supposed to be the most
perfect, gracious queen ever.

979
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:59,125
Ella seems like she
can't even stand royalty.

980
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:01,708
Yeah, you know, the
craziest thing of it all...

981
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:03,625
They were best friends.

982
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:12,125
Okay, well, now the question is, how
do we stop Uliana before Castlecoming?

983
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:15,541
First, we have to figure
out what she's planning.

984
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:17,000
Bugs in Bridget's dress?

985
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,916
Or... Or something with snakes?

986
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,208
So many good options.

987
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,666
So, let's find out
more about Uliana.

988
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,291
You think my mom might know?

989
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:30,208
Maybe. Plus she's
closest to Bridget.

990
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:33,541
So, she'll know her weaknesses and
exactly how to stab her in the back.

991
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,333
You have some serious
intimacy issues.

992
00:56:40,041 --> 00:56:41,041
Hmm.

993
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:44,708
This is where
Cinderella grew up?

994
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:46,458
I hope not.

995
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,041
Whoa. This place is
not what I expected.

996
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:13,916
Um...

997
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,291
What are you guys doing here?

998
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:17,708
- We came to see you.
- Who's there?

999
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:20,916
Just some girls from school!

1000
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,041
Well, get back to
work or no supper!

1001
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:31,375
Sorry, my stepmom is...

1002
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:32,541
A total witch?

1003
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:35,833
I get it, my mom never
let me have friends over.

1004
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:38,333
Or have friends.

1005
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:40,500
Really?

1006
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:48,708
Okay, you guys can stay, but you
have to help me with my chores.

1007
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:50,833
Oh!

1008
00:57:50,916 --> 00:57:52,750
Here you go. The
floor needs mopping.

1009
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,500
And over there needs dusting.

1010
00:57:57,833 --> 00:58:00,750
- You do all the house work?
- Yeah, all on me.

1011
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:02,166
Oh.

1012
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,500
Hey, it's time to
lose the glass shoes.

1013
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:14,458
These were from my mom.

1014
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:15,666
They were a reward.

1015
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:20,125
- A reward for what?
- For volunteering,

1016
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:23,375
being good at school,
and being a good person.

1017
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,958
I mean, does it really
count as being a good person

1018
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:27,541
if you're getting
a reward for it?

1019
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:33,916
So, Ella, that thing with Uliana
at school, it's pretty wild. Huh?

1020
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Seriously.

1021
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:38,708
Well, she's as bad as Ursula,
Uliana's older sister.

1022
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:41,958
And the worst bully this
school has ever seen.

1023
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:44,291
One time she turned all
the freshmen into frogs.

1024
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:46,833
Now Uliana thinks she
has to be even meaner

1025
00:58:46,916 --> 00:58:48,750
to try and live up
to her reputation.

1026
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:51,250
But why does Uliana
have it out for Bridget?

1027
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:52,625
Bridget is so nice.

1028
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:55,125
Exactly. Bullies
love an easy target,

1029
00:58:55,208 --> 00:58:57,041
and Bridget's weak.

1030
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:00,958
You think Bridget's weak?

1031
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:04,333
Hey, look.

1032
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,625
Uliana is mean to everyone.

1033
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:08,750
Most people just
stay out of her way.

1034
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:11,375
But no matter how
nasty Uliana gets,

1035
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:14,458
Bridget keeps trying
to be friends.

1036
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:17,000
That's what Uliana can't stand.

1037
00:59:17,083 --> 00:59:21,333
Wait, so, you're saying Bridget's
strong because she's nice?

1038
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:25,125
Bridget is the
strongest person I know.

1039
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,416
She's kind, even when
people are awful to her.

1040
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,958
You know how hard that is?

1041
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:34,500
Never thought about it.

1042
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:42,541
Say we wanted to find Uliana,
where do you think she'd be?

1043
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:43,916
Probably the Black Lagoon.

1044
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:48,083
- That's where all the VKs hang out.
- Ooh.

1045
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:52,375
What was that?

1046
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:54,375
Nothing, Stepmother!

1047
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:57,708
Quick, sweep it into the
fireplace. She'll never know.

1048
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,375
It was an honest mistake.

1049
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,875
It was my fault.

1050
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:16,416
But I'm very sorry, and it
won't ever happen again.

1051
01:00:17,416 --> 01:00:21,791
You let this stranger
into my house

1052
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:24,291
and let her break
my beautiful things?

1053
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:27,458
- Unacceptable.
- But I said I was sorry.

1054
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:31,208
Well, sorry doesn't buy me
a new vase now, does it?

1055
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:36,833
And furthermore,
you are grounded.

1056
01:00:42,166 --> 01:00:44,166
And tonight, you can
sleep in the barn.

1057
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:49,875
Anastasia, Drizella!

1058
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:52,750
It's time for your
dress fitting.

1059
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:57,958
Ella, I'm...

1060
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:00,250
I'm so sorry.

1061
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:03,041
Sorry doesn't get me
ungrounded, you know?

1062
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:06,166
Next time, don't
be such a princess.

1063
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,291
But that was so unfair!

1064
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:10,208
You know what's unfair?

1065
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:16,125
My mom died when I was so
little, I barely even remember.

1066
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:20,458
My dad got remarried
and then he died too.

1067
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:25,083
And since then, this is
the only family I've known.

1068
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:30,833
And no matter how good I am,
they still treat me like dirt.

1069
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:36,791
Yeah, it's unfair...

1070
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:39,708
'Cause life isn't fair.

1071
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:42,916
Just leave.

1072
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,333
We should give
her a little time.

1073
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:02,083
So this is the Black Lagoon.

1074
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:12,750
I thought you were a
beautiful flamingo, Uli.

1075
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:13,833

1076
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:16,250

And turn her into a monster.

1142
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:39,000
What was that?

1143
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:43,750
Come on.

1144
01:05:58,541 --> 01:05:59,541
You okay?

1145
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,041
Yeah.

1146
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:04,708
Thanks.

1147
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,500
You're no good to
me as fish food.

1148
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:13,041
We can still stop them
before Castlecoming.

1149
01:06:13,125 --> 01:06:15,375
- But that means...
- We got a book to find.

1150
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:21,083
Where could that book be?

1151
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:23,708
Who could we ask? Not Ella.

1152
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:26,791
I still can't believe how
awful her family was to her.

1153
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:30,708
I just... I don't understand how
someone could grow up like that,

1154
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:33,833
and then turn
into, well, my mom.

1155
01:06:34,666 --> 01:06:37,500
I mean, how can one
person change so much?

1156
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:39,833
Tell me about it.

1157
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:42,875
My mom changed her
entire personality.

1158
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:48,125
It's like everything she does now is
to make people afraid of her and...

1159
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:50,583
And to hide the fact that
she used to actually be nice.

1160
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:54,291
Well, whatever we do, we have to
make sure that she stays that way.

1161
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:56,583
My mom's life depends on it.

1162
01:06:58,291 --> 01:06:59,625
Think about it.

1163
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:02,166
What if your mom had grown
up to be like Bridget?

1164
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:07,958
You mean completely clueless?

1165
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:11,083
Or kind, generous
and open-hearted.

1166
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:13,750
She wouldn't have
become a tyrant.

1167
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:18,875
Yeah, I could eat what I
want, and sleep when I want,

1168
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:22,208
and wear what I want,
and be what I want.

1169
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:28,083
I'd be free of my mom, and her
rules, and her judge-y face.

1170
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:29,916
She might not be judge-y at all.

1171
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:33,000
She might be loving and kind.

1172
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:36,041
It doesn't matter. It's not
like I actually care about that.

1173
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:39,375
I think maybe you do.

1174
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,583
Speakin' of Bridget...

1175
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:50,958
What if the watch brought us back
here because what you really want

1176
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:54,000
is a mom who can love
you the way that you are?

1177
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:56,875
A mom more like Bridget.

1178
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:02,291
She'd probably still
be making cupcakes.

1179
01:08:04,666 --> 01:08:07,416
That's it. We should ask
Bridget about the cookbook.

1180
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,500

Who's against fun?

1205
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,250
Our Queen.

1206
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,083
AKA, my mom.

1207
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:34,583
Oh.

1208
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:38,375
She also hates my

you know, everything about me.

1210

I'm sorry, Red.

1211
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:44,958
I can't imagine having
a mom like that.

1212
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,666
She's the only one
I've ever known.

1213
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:53,416
Well, if I was your mom,

1214
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,166
I'd love to have a daughter
who thinks for herself.

1215
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:11,625
Is that The Looking Glass?

1216
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:14,000
Oh. Yeah.

1217
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:17,000
You've heard of it?

1218
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:19,291
Uh, I've read about it.

1219
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:20,541
It was a gift.

1220
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:22,791
It's been in the Wonderland
royal line for ages.

1221
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:23,875
What's it do?

1222
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:25,125
It shows you the future.

1223
01:10:26,416 --> 01:10:28,416
- Have you looked?
- No, no, no, no.

1224
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,500
I love surprises.

1225
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:33,041
I mean, why would I
wanna spoil the future?

1226
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:36,208
I'm sure it'll be wonderful.

1227
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:41,041
Anyway, we were hoping you might
be able to help us find a cookbook.

1228
01:10:41,125 --> 01:10:43,166
Yeah. Well, then you've
got the right girl!

1229
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,750
I mean, I have
every cookbook ever.

1230
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:47,250
Even The Sorcerer's Cookbook?

1231
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:49,541
Hmm. Let me look.

1232
01:10:51,708 --> 01:10:53,708
♪ Shuffle of Shuffle of love ♪

1233
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,625
♪ Shuffle of The
shuffle of love ♪

1234
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:57,625
♪ Shuffle of Shuffle of love ♪

1235
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:59,500
♪ The shuffle of love ♪

1236
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,666
What are you doing?

1237
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,500
Checking how things
are going back home.

1238
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:05,458
- Let me go.
- Oh, Charming.

1239
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:07,916
So nice to see you again.

1240
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,791
Where is she?

1241
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:12,000
Where's Cinderella?

1242
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:13,875
Why?

1243
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:18,875
- No.
- Are you looking for these?

1244
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:20,791
What have you done?

1245
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:29,916
- Not so funny now, am I?
- No.

1246
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,500
What...

1247
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:36,083
No...

1248
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,708
No!

1249
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,875
No!

1250
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:47,541
Okay, so... not good.

1251
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:55,625
That's weird, yeah, I
thought I had them all.

1252
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:57,000
Well, except the banned ones.

1253
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:58,708
Where would we find
the banned ones?

1254
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:00,083
We don't.

1255
01:12:00,166 --> 01:12:01,750
They're dangerous.

1256
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:04,333
That's why Principal Merlin
locked them up in his office.

1257
01:12:04,416 --> 01:12:08,250
And enchanted them so no troublemakers
can get their hands on them.

1258
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:17,333
Now that we know where the book
is, I think the solution is clear.

1259
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:18,500
For sure.

1260
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:19,833
There's only one option.

1261
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:20,916
Yeah.

1262
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:23,208
It's time to tell
Principal Merlin.

1263
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,250
We need to come
clean. He can help us.

1264
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:27,041
No. Help us?

1265
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:29,875
You think he'll hand over a
banned book because we asked him?

1266
01:12:29,958 --> 01:12:31,250
Do you have a better idea?

1267
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:33,416
Yeah. We do it ourselves.

1268
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,916
We break in and steal it.

1269
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,875
That's what Uliana's gonna do.

1270
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:38,083
Unless we get there first.

1271
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:40,916
You wanna break in to
the Principal's office?

1272
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,208
It's enchanted.

1273
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:44,208
And Castlecoming is tomorrow.

1274
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:47,333
We only have one shot to get this
right. And your idea is to steal?

1275
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:49,458
And your plan is to
go tell the teacher?

1276
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:50,958
You're such a goody-goody.

1277
01:12:51,041 --> 01:12:53,458
I'd rather be a goody-goody
than a bad person.

1278
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:55,541
- You sound like your mom.
- Thank you.

1279
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:56,958
How'd that work out for her?

1280
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:01,791
Wow.

1281
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:05,750
You know, you are evil.

1282
01:13:06,666 --> 01:13:08,250
Just like your mom.

1283
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:14,541
Yeah, maybe...

1284
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:18,458
But I'm gonna get us outta here.

1285
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,375
Hey.

1286
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:42,250
Can I talk to you
about something?

1287
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:45,291
Normally, I'd talk to my mom

1288
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:46,958
when I have a problem,

1289
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:50,458
but she's far away
right now. So...

1290
01:13:51,916 --> 01:13:53,083
Say you have a friend...

1291
01:13:53,166 --> 01:13:58,541
Well, not a friend, but, someone
you know who's a bad person.

1292
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:01,291
And how do you know
they're a bad person?

1293
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:02,750
'Cause she says so herself.

1294
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,708
Bad people don't think
that they're bad.

1295
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:12,916
Trust me, I live with one.

1296
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,666
What if she keeps pushing
you to do something bad,

1297
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,666

for a good reason?

01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:54,166
Thanks.

1361
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:07,125
Coast is clear.

1362
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,791
Not yet.

1363
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
What are you doing here?

1364
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:41,541
Getting my hands dirty.

1365
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:45,333
You're gonna break into
the Principal's office?

1366
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:47,333
It's for a good cause.

1367
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:48,708
Oh.

1368
01:17:48,791 --> 01:17:51,833
And you're already justifying
your crimes? Love it.

1369
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:17,125
Morgie, honey, you
keep lookout, okay?

1370
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:20,208
If you see Merlin
coming, give a signal.

1371
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:23,000
Should I do a wolf howl?

1372
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:24,125
Or like a dog howl?

1373
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,791
I can do different dogs.

1374
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:31,791
I'll check up there.

1375
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:39,166
Wait. I think I see it.
The big one with the claws.

1376
01:18:58,583 --> 01:18:59,625
Almost got it.

1377
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:05,333
Oh, boy.

1378
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,583
- Run!
- Move.

1379
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:15,666
Let's go.

1380
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:18,708
Oh, no. The owl, he's
gonna tell Merlin.

1381
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:42,791
Red, I can hold them.

1382
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:44,666
Grab the book!

1383
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:50,875
No!

1384
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,500
Red!

1385
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:08,583
Hey!

1386
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,035
They're disappearing.

1387
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:26,333
I think I can make it.

1388
01:20:41,541 --> 01:20:42,583
Oh, no!

1389
01:20:49,916 --> 01:20:51,250
Red, watch out!

1390
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:56,666
The owl, he got the book.

1391
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:22,333
We got 'em.

1392
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:26,666
Are you okay?

1393
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:28,750
Those were from your mom.

1394
01:21:29,958 --> 01:21:31,791
It was time to lose
the glass shoes.

1395
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:38,208
Wow.

1396
01:21:38,708 --> 01:21:40,500
What a performance.

1397
01:21:44,958 --> 01:21:46,041
Well...

1398
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:48,000
I'll be taking that.

1399
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:52,125
Hey, get your slimy
suckers off that!

1400
01:21:52,208 --> 01:21:53,625
- Aw!
- I don't think so.

1401
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,541
It's over.

1402
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:58,083
There's too many of them.

1403
01:21:58,166 --> 01:22:00,000
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1404
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:01,083
Hmm.

1405
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:02,500
Finally.

1406
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:12,125
Let's see what kind of
mischief you've got for me.

1407
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:20,958
I can't move.

1408
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:32,375
Hex yeah!

1409
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:37,875
Hmm.

1410
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,166
Hey.

1411
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,416
No. Stop.

1412
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:49,791
New shoes? My treat.

1413
01:22:49,875 --> 01:22:50,875
Nice.

1414
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:56,333
How did you know that
was gonna happen?

1415
01:22:56,416 --> 01:22:58,541
Bridget said that Merlin
enchanted the cookbook

1416
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:00,541
so it doesn't fall
into the wrong hands.

1417
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:04,458
Oh. Right.

1418
01:23:05,708 --> 01:23:08,125
You should probably
open this then.

1419
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:10,250
These are definitely
the wrong hands.

1420
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:13,458
No.

1421
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:15,958
You do it.

1422
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:17,750
Um...

1423
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:21,083
I'm evil like my mom, remember?

1424
01:23:21,166 --> 01:23:23,458
You're nothing
like your mom, Red.

1425
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:25,583
You're your own person.

1426
01:23:25,666 --> 01:23:27,083
You're a good person.

1427
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:29,833
No.

1428
01:23:31,416 --> 01:23:32,958
Chloe, I lie.

1429
01:23:33,916 --> 01:23:35,000
Cheat.

1430
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:37,458
I steal.

1431
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:39,041
I'm a lost cause.

1432
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:42,000
Well, you also just
stood up to a bully.

1433
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:44,166
And you risked your
own life to save mine.

1434
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:46,416
And right now, you're
saving Auradon.

1435
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I thought that being good was
about following the rules.

1436
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:52,500
But turns out, it's a
lot more complicated.

1437
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:56,250
You do so much good, Red.

1438
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,750
I'm sorry it took me
so long to see it.

1439
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:02,750
You got this.

1440
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:10,583
Okay.

1441
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:31,833
Told you.

1442
01:24:34,416 --> 01:24:35,958
Blasted owl.

1443
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:38,666
Ooh, Archimedes better
be right this time.

1444
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:47,208
Right quick!

1445
01:24:58,583 --> 01:24:59,833
Wait, how did you know?

1446
01:24:59,916 --> 01:25:02,291
Yeah, I was, like,
80 percent max.

1447
01:25:02,916 --> 01:25:06,583
I could've been perma-frozen,
and you were only 80 percent?

1448
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:11,458
Rain, rain, rain.

1449
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:13,208
Stupendous. Now
I'm getting a cold.

1450
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:15,541
Where's the key? Blasted owl.

1451
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:26,541
Oh, hello, down there.

1452
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:37,083
Well, I hope you
enjoy detention,

1453
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:40,750
since you've just
signed up for years.

1454
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:48,708
Did you see Uliana's face
when she opened up the book?

1455
01:25:48,791 --> 01:25:50,916
She was like...

1456
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,708
I wish I could see her while she's stuck
at home on the night of Castlecoming.

1457
01:25:54,791 --> 01:25:57,458
I bet she's like... "Hmm!"

1458
01:25:59,541 --> 01:26:02,625
Wait, are we sure that
she won't be there?

1459
01:26:03,333 --> 01:26:07,208
Uh, yeah. The VKs are gonna
be in detention forever.

1460
01:26:07,291 --> 01:26:09,583
And even if they could
go to Castlecoming,

1461
01:26:09,666 --> 01:26:12,375
with no cookbook, there's no
way they can do the prank.

1462
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:15,541
We did it.

1463
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:17,666
We can go back.

1464
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:18,833
We can go home.

1465
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,500
Yeah.

1466
01:26:23,916 --> 01:26:27,541
But what if we go back and
my mom is still... My mom?

1467
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,875
Even if she is, you're
not gonna end up like her.

1468
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:33,041
And this?

1469
01:26:34,416 --> 01:26:35,833
This is proof.

1470
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:39,375
You saved my mom's life.

1471
01:26:56,166 --> 01:26:57,166
Here.

1472
01:26:58,833 --> 01:26:59,958
This belongs to you.

1473
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,500
Ready?

1474
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:08,208
Ready.

1475
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:17,267
- Off with her head.
- Mom!

1476
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:18,642
I will never kneel to a tyrant.

1477
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:20,476
- First dance.
- Bibbidi-bobbidi...

1478
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,500
It's my life!

1479
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,333
What's my name?

1480
01:27:25,416 --> 01:27:27,333
Uma!

1481
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:31,916
That's Principal Uma to you.

1482
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,500
And you better get it straight,
or you'll be walking the plank.

1483
01:27:36,583 --> 01:27:38,125
She's just kidding.

1484
01:27:38,208 --> 01:27:39,208
She's kidding.

1485
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:43,833
Now, I never got the chance
to go to Auradon Prep.

1486
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:46,541
But as its captain,

1487
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:50,958
I'm proud to be charting a new
course into a bright future.

1488
01:27:53,375 --> 01:27:54,375
Excuse me.

1489
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:56,083
Do you mind?

1490
01:27:57,333 --> 01:27:58,750
I do, actually.

1491
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:02,500
Mom, what are you doing?

1492
01:28:02,583 --> 01:28:05,208
Why, playing my favorite game.

1493
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:14,458
Hearts!

1494
01:28:22,416 --> 01:28:24,291
Oh, I love bubbles!

1495
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:33,458
I love it.

1496
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:43,291
I'm so sorry, I
couldn't help myself!

1497
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:47,500
I'm just so excited for
my daughter to be here.

1498
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:49,125
Aw!

1499
01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:56,875
Well, nothing I say
is gonna top that.

1500
01:28:56,958 --> 01:29:00,208
So, have a great year, y'all.

1501
01:29:02,166 --> 01:29:04,416
You saved our moms.

1502
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:05,916
You changed history.

1503
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,416
